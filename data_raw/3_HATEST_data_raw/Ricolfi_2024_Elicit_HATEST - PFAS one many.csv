- The mention of ""6:2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate (6:2 Cl-PFAES) and its homologues"" indicates specific types of PFAS being discussed, further supporting the focus on multiple PFAS substances."
Perfluoroalkyl substances and lipid concentrations in the blood: A systematic review of epidemiological studies,"Soon Hoe Ho, Stacy Xin, Hui Soh, Min Xian Wang, Janet Ong, Annabel Seah, Yvonne Wong, Zhanxiong Fang, Shuzhen Sim, Jue Tao Lim, C L E I N F O, Adrian Covaci",-,-,Science of the Total Environment,50,2022,Ho_2022.pdf,multiple,"  - ""This review will include perfluoroalkyl substances such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), but exclude polyfluoroalkyl substances like perfluoroalkane sulfonamido substances and fluorotelomer substances.""
  - ""We did not set any limit on the type of PFAS reviewed in order to broaden our coverage, and focussed specifically on peer-reviewed articles to ensure the validity of the findings; hence grey literature was excluded.""
  - ""a total of 15 PFAS were examined by the 58 articles reviewed, not all were studied equally with PFOA and PFOS being assessed more frequently than the rest.""
  - ""We found evidence that the associations between PFAS and cholesterol tended to be positive, especially between PFOA-LDL, PFOA-TC, PFOS-TC, and PFNA-LDL.""
  - ""The conclusion that the associations between PFAS and cholesterol (LDL, HDL, TC) levels tended to be positive is supported by findings from the secondary outcomes.""
  - ""In conclusion, this is one of the few systematic reviews to comprehensively assess the effect of exposure to a variety of PFAS on LDL, HDL, TC and TG concentrations in human populations.""",,"- The review explicitly states that it includes multiple types of PFAS, such as PFOA, PFOS, and PFHxS, indicating a focus on more than one type of PFAS.
- The review mentions that it did not set any limit on the type of PFAS reviewed, which suggests a comprehensive approach covering various PFAS types.
- The paper notes that 15 different PFAS were examined, which further supports the idea that the review is focused on multiple types of PFAS.
- The findings highlight associations between several PFAS types and lipid concentrations, reinforcing the focus on multiple PFAS types.
- The conclusion emphasizes the comprehensive assessment of various PFAS on lipid concentrations, confirming the focus on multiple PFAS types."
The Association between ADHD and Environmental Chemicals-A Scoping Review,"Sonja Moore, Laura Paalan, Lisa Melym, Andromachi Katsonouri, Marike Kolossa-Gehring, Hanna Tolonen",-,-,-,-,-,Moore_2022.pdf,multiple,"  - ""Five studies in which exposure was assessed either before birth or during childhood were identified in another review with a broader outcome definition""
  - ""Two studies on perfluoroalkyl compounds (PFCs) (i.e., PFASs) during childhood and ADHD were included in a review by Nilsen and Tulve (2020)""",,"- The paper mentions ""per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs)"" as a group, indicating that the review considers multiple types of PFAS substances.
- The specific mention of ""perfluoroalkyl compounds (PFCs)"" suggests that this is one type of PFAS focused on in the review.
- The paper does not specify a single type of PFAS as the sole focus; instead, it refers to PFASs in general, which implies a broader consideration of multiple types within this category.
- The mention of multiple studies assessing exposure to PFASs at different stages (before birth or during childhood) further supports the idea that the review is not limited to a single type of PFAS."
