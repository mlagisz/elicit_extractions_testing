Online engagement for sustainable energy projects: A Systematic review and framework for integration,Danielle Barrios-O'neill,-,-,,34,2016,Barrios-ONeill_2016.pdf,not declared specifically,"  - ""The following exclusion criteria and exemptions were used, which narrowed this to 70 studies:

  - ""The NS approach was used in order to analyse the complex multidisciplinary nature of the research topic, and the current lack of cohesive data structures within it, problems impeding focused policy solutions in this area thus far (Victor, 2008;Pierce & Paulos, 2012).""
  - ""A potential limitation of this method is that outcomes will not reflect the complete range of possibilities and risks related to interactive media engagement and sustainability.""

  - ""There is a distinct need to investigate interactive communications strategy relative to energy organisation type, for example how government organisations can meet challenges specific to their sector, or even more specifically, how renewable energy projects in development such as offshore wind farms can address unique risks related to reputation and trust, and how consumers can become more involved in the smart grid.""",,"- The paper discusses the methodology used for the systematic review, including the exclusion criteria and the thematic analysis approach.
- It mentions the limitations of the Narrative Synthesis (NS) method, such as not reflecting the complete range of possibilities and risks, and issues with consistency in identifying relevant findings.

- The paper does not explicitly mention a PRISMA-like diagram or flow diagram illustrating the search and screening process.
- The tables provided in the paper contain detailed information about the studies included in the review, but there is no mention of a PRISMA-like diagram.
- The authors suggest a checklist for future studies, which implies a structured approach to reporting results, but again, there is no explicit mention of a PRISMA-like diagram in this paper."
Urban green spaces' effectiveness as a psychological buffer for the negative health impact of noise pollution: A systematic review,"Angel Mario Dzhambov, Donka Dimitrova,  Dimitrova",-,-,Noise and Health,182,2014,Dzhambov_2014.pdf,not declared specifically,"  - ""We present some of the limitations of our review. Probably the most prominent limitation is the limited number of studies which, on one hand, does not allow us to make fi rm inferences, but on the other only reiterates the necessity for further research.""
