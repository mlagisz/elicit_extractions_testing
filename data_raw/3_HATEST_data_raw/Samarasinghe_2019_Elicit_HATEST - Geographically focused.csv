Built environmental correlates of older adults' total physical activity and walking: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"David W Barnett, Anthony Barnett, Andrea Nathan, Jelle Van Cauwenberg, Ester Cerin",-,-,-,-,-,Barnett_2017.pdf,no,"  - ""One postulated reason for the lack of consistent significant associations between environmental correlates and PA was the relative 'western' bias of the reviewed research -68% of the 31 articles reviewed by Van Cauwenberg and colleagues were from North America alone [15].""
  - ""This is an important limitation since homogenously low-density western cities lack environmental variability potentially resulting in the underestimation of the strength of associations between the built environment and PA.""
  - ""Also, western cities differ from the built environments of Africa, Asia, and South America, limiting the generalizability of findings [16][17][18].""
  - ""In consideration of the recent growing evidence from nonwestern countries (e.g., [19][20][21][22][23][24][25]), an update of the literature was necessary.""
  - ""Our systematic literature search followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [39] and was an extended update of Van Cauwenberg et al.'s 2011 review [15] including additional electronic databases and search terms to account for grey literature, experimental research, a greater variety of built environmental attributes and older adults' PA.""
  - ""Systematic searches were performed in the following electronic databases (September -November 2016): Cinahl, PubMed, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, TRIS, and Web of Science.""
  - ""Article eligibility for inclusion was based on the following criteria: (1) published in English between 1st January 2000 and 3rd September 2016; (2) quantitative study; (3) study with a cross-sectional, longitudinal or quasi-experimental design; (4) a sample with a mean age ≥ 65 years; (5) investigated the association between any objective or perceived attribute of the built environment and objectively measured or self-reported PA and/or walking that was not specific to a single PA domain only; (6) did not exclusively focus on clinical populations (e.g., overweight, disabled or institutionalised participants); and (7) did not investigate associations between PA and the built environment with an ill-defined aggregated environmental measure that, for example, combined two weakly correlated attributes such as access to/availability of recreational facilities and traffic/ pedestrian safety.""
  - ""Almost half of all studies (46%) were based in North America, followed by Europe (22%), Asia (16%), Oceania (13%), two studies from South America [23,24], and one pilot study from South Africa [25].""
  - ""Regarding countries, the USA (36%), Australia (13%), the UK (10%), and Canada (10%) conducted the most research.""",,"- The paper discusses the limitations of previous reviews, such as the ""western"" bias, indicating a need to include studies from a broader geographic range.
- The authors mention the inclusion of additional databases and search terms to account for grey literature and studies from non-western countries, suggesting a global focus.
- The eligibility criteria for article inclusion do not specify any particular geographic region, indicating that the review is not geographically focused.
- The paper includes studies from various regions, such as North America, Europe, Asia, Oceania, South America, and Africa, further supporting a global rather than geographically focused approach."

  - ""The aim of this research is to present a critical review of impacts of heat waves and corresponding mechanisms.""
  - ""The papers published in international journals and conference proceedings covered the heat wave related studies in both Australia and overseas.""
  - ""It is also very common that the reports from research institutes and international organizations (e.g.  WHO and WMO) used Australia as one of cases for dealing with heat waves.""
  - ""there are very few studies focusing on a systematic review of the effects of heat waves and mechanisms to mitigate these effects in Australia context.""
  - ""This will provide useful inputs for policy making and industry practice to improve the resilience of urban and regional areas to deal with extreme weather conditions such as heat waves.""
  - ""Another contribution of this study is the identification of the implications following the extensive review of literature related to heat waves. This includes the improvement of building design of dwellings by considering the changing climatic conditions in Australia.""",,"- The paper aims to provide inputs for policy making and industry practice globally, as indicated by the mention of improving resilience in urban and regional areas in the context of extreme weather conditions.

- The focus on building design improvements in Australia is part of the broader discussion on global implications and does not limit the review to Australia alone."
Latent heat storage in building elements: A systematic review on properties and contextual performance factors,"A Mavrigiannaki, E Ampatzi",-,-,,78,2016,Mavrigiannaki_2016.pdf,no,"  - ""A systematic review of latent heat storage in building elements was conducted to establish the current knowledge base and reveal key design and performance factors that could be used to define technologies available for immediate implementation and for specific applications.""
  - ""The review of a total of 120 papers revealed that published information on these aspects is diverse and in many cases insufficient.""
  - ""The diversity of test conditions and variety of reported values indicate that physical properties and performance data concerning materials and complete PCM elements are not directly comparable.""
  - ""Therefore matching technologies and applications for specific climates and building typologies is not possible solely through published information.""
  - ""The review also mapped the research foci to date, revealing the range of variations previously examined and potential research gaps worth pursuing in the future.""
  - ""The search was deliberately broad, to allow all relevant publications indexed in the two databases to be identified.""
  - ""The firstgenericset search (A) was performed in September 2013 (Web of Science). The focused set search includes publications available online up to April 2014 (Web of Science þ Scopus).""
  - ""The search process tracked 140 studies to be reviewed. These covered a variety of building elements; more popular being walls (Fig. 2""
  - ""The review of published research revealed that a range of parameters that are key to the performance of these systems can be identified.""
  - ""The review has shown that with appropriate design, PCM elements can contribute to reducing loads and achieving energy savings in buildings, while securing a comfortable indoor environment.""",,"- The paper's abstract and introduction indicate that the review aims to establish a current knowledge base and identify key design and performance factors for latent heat storage in building elements. This suggests a broad focus rather than a geographically specific one.
- The review includes a diverse range of studies, indicating that the focus is not limited to a particular geographic region.
- The search process was described as ""deliberately broad,"" which implies that the review aimed to include studies from various geographic locations rather than focusing on a specific region.
- The paper does not mention any specific geographic focus or exclusion criteria based on location, which further supports the conclusion that the review is not geographically focused."
