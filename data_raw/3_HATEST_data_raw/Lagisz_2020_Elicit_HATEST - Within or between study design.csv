Can the way pigs are handled alter behavioural and physiological measures of affective state?,"Ricard Carreras, Laura Arroyo, Eva Mainau, Daniel Valent, Anna Bassols, Antoni Dalmau, Luigi Faucitano, Xavier Manteca, Antonio Velarde",-,-,Behavioural Processes,16,2017,Carreras2017.pdf,between,"  - ""In the present study, the influence of positive and negative handling (pH and NH, respectively) on affective state and fear as assessed by the cognitive bias test, the novel object test and the defence cascade test was studied in 56 pigs.""
  - ""The pigs in one of the rooms received positive handling (pH) and the pigs in the other room received negative handling (NH).""
  - ""The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of IRTA.""
  - ""Treatments started when pigs aged 19 weeks and lasted until 27 weeks of age (slaughter age) (Table 1""
  - ""The pH treatment consisted in entering the room slowly and letting the pigs looking at the experimenter with binocular vision before entering the pens.""
  - ""The NH treatment consisted in entering the room quickly and talking loudly.""
  - ""The present study aimed at assessing the effect of pH vs. NH on the pigs' affective state and the fear response, as assessed by the CBT and NOT, respectively.""
  - ""The hypothesis of this study was that pigs with a pH experience have a more optimistic response in the CBT, are less reactive to a sudden stimulus and resume the activity faster in the DCT, are less fearful in the NOT and have lower concentrations of cortisol than pigs with a NH experience.""
  - ""In this study, 56 female pigs ((Landrace x Large White) x Piétrain) were used.""
  - ""At 9 weeks of age, pigs were transported from a commercial farm to the experimental facilities of IRTA (Monells, Spain) and housed in two rooms of four pens with seven pigs each.""",,"- The study involved two distinct groups of pigs, each subjected to different handling treatments: positive handling (pH) and negative handling (NH). This indicates a between-individual study design, as different groups of animals were simultaneously subjected to different treatments.
- The description of the experimental setup, where pigs in one room received positive handling and pigs in another room received negative handling, further supports the between-individual design.
- The study's aim to assess the effect of pH vs. NH on pigs' affective state and fear response also aligns with a between-individual design, as it compares the outcomes between two separate groups."
"Does stocking density modify affective state in pigs as assessed by cognitive bias, behavioural and physiological parameters?","Annalisa Scollo, Flaviana Gottardo, Barbara Contiero, Sandra A Edwards",-,-,,62,2014,Scollo2014.pdf,between,"  - ""Pigs were tested in two batches on alternate days, within which the two treatments were counterbalanced.""
  - ""Animals were housed in 4 matched pens of 10 pigs each (5 females and 5 males).""
  - ""Two pens of pigs were housed at each of two different stocking densities.""
  - ""Forty growing pigs were housed in groups of 10 at different density for 8 weeks prior to the start of the test.""",,"- The study involved 40 pigs divided into groups of 10, housed at different densities. This indicates that there were multiple groups of animals, each receiving a different treatment.
- The mention of ""two pens of pigs were housed at each of two different stocking densities"" suggests that there were two distinct groups for each density level, which aligns with a between-group design.
- The use of ""4 matched pens"" further supports the idea that there were multiple groups, as each pen likely represented a different treatment condition.
- The testing procedure involved two batches tested on alternate days with counterbalanced treatments, which is consistent with a between-group design where different groups receive different treatments simultaneously."
Effect of gender and halothane genotype on cognitive bias and its relationship with fear in pigs,"Ricard Carreras, Laura Arroyo, Eva Mainau, Raquel Pe Ña, Anna Bassols, Antoni Dalmau, Luigi Faucitano, Xavier Manteca, Antonio Velarde",-,-,,17,2016,Carreras2016.pdf,between,"  - ""The overall objective of this study was to determine the CB in pigs of different gender and carrying or not carrying the Hal gene.""
  - ""The CBT and NOT results did not show any effect of the genotype and gender or their interaction on pigs' emotional response (p > 0.10).""
  - ""In this study, 48 crossbred pigs (Landrace × Large White sows sired with Piétrain boars) were divided into four groups of 12 pigs each. Each group either consisted of Hal-free gilts, Hal-free entire males (NNG and NNEM), Hal carrier gilts and Hal carrier entire males (NnG and NnEM).""
  - ""A total of 48 pigs, in terms of 12Hal-free gilts (NNG), 12Hal carrier gilts (NnG), and 12Hal-free entire males (NNEM) and 12Hal carrier entire males (NnEM) were put on the CBT at the age of 20 weeks and on the NOT four days later.""",,"- The study involved 48 pigs divided into four groups based on gender and halothane genotype: Hal-free gilts, Hal carrier gilts, Hal-free entire males, and Hal carrier entire males. This indicates that there were multiple groups of animals, each with a different combination of gender and genotype.
- The study aimed to investigate the effects of gender and halothane genotype on cognitive bias, which suggests a comparison between these different groups.
- The mention of ""48 pigs divided into four groups"" and the objective to ""determine the CB in pigs of different gender and carrying or not carrying the Hal gene"" supports a between-individual study design, as different groups of animals were subjected to different conditions (gender and genotype) simultaneously.
- The fact that the CBT and NOT results were compared across these groups further supports a between-individual design, as it involves comparing outcomes between different groups rather than within the same group over time."
"Effects of Cage Enrichment on Behavior, Welfare and Outcome Variability in Female Mice","Jeremy D Bailoo, Eimear Murphy, Maria Boada-Saña, Justin A Varholick, Sara Hintze, Caroline Baussière, Kerstin C Hahn, Christine Göpfert, Rupert Palme, Bernhard Voelkl, Hanno Würbel",-,-,Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience,85,2018,Bailoo_2018.pdf,between,"  - ""The SE housing condition consisted of a Makrolon Type three cage connected to a Savic TM Mickey XL pet cage, by a clear polycarbonate tunnel 6 cm in diameter.""
  - ""The B, N and E housing conditions consisted of a Makrolon Type three cage, which besides food (Kliba Nafag #3430, Switzerland) and tap water ad libitum, contained either bedding only (B; Lignocel select, see Supplementary Table S1 for depth), bedding and nesting material (N), or deeper bedding, nesting material, a tunnel, a shelter and increased vertical space (E).""
  - ""Mice were randomly allocated to the four housing conditions, B, N, E and SE, described in further detail in Supplementary Table S1""
  - ""We used a 4 (cage enrichment) × 2 (mouse strain) factorial design conducted in two consecutive batches of equal size; the second batch began 3 weeks after the end of the first batch.""
  - ""Here, using 96 C57BL/6 and SWISS female mice, respectively, we systematically varied environmental enrichment across four levels spanning the range of common enrichment strategies: (1) bedding alone; (2) bedding + nesting material; (3) deeper bedding + nesting material + shelter + increased vertical space; and (4) semi-naturalistic conditions, including weekly changes of enrichment items.""",,"- The study involved two strains of mice (C57BL/6 and SWISS) and four different levels of environmental enrichment, indicating a factorial design.
- The mice were randomly allocated to these different housing conditions, which suggests that different groups of mice were exposed to different treatments simultaneously.
- The use of a factorial design with multiple groups receiving different treatments at the same time aligns with a between-individual study design.
- There is no mention of the same group of animals being subjected to different treatments sequentially, which would be indicative of a within-individual design."
Frontal brain deactivation during a non-verbal cognitive judgement bias test in sheep,"Kathrin Guldimann, Sabine Vögeli, Martin Wolf, Beat Wechsler, Lorenz Gygax",-,-,Brain and Cognition,20,2015,Guldimann2015.pdf,between,"  - ""Here, we conducted a spatial variant of such a test on 24 focal animals that were kept under either unpredictable, stimulus-poor or predictable, stimulus-rich housing conditions to induce differential mood states.""
  - ""Sheep from the unpredictable, stimulus-poor housing conditions took longer and were less likely to reach the learning criterion and reacted slightly more optimistically in the cognitive judgement bias test than sheep from the predictable, stimulus-rich housing conditions.""
  - ""Twenty-nine female non-lactating and non-gestating Lacaune sheep about 2.5 years of age made up the two groups used in this experiment (Vögeli et al., 2014). 24 focal sheep (12 from each housing group) that had previously been chosen at random were included in the cognitive judgement bias test.""
  - ""To induce a relatively more negative or more positive mood, the sheep had been subjected to either unpredictable, stimulus-poor or predictable, stimulus-rich housing conditions, respectively, since July 2011 (Vögeli et al., 2014).""
  - ""The sheep from the predictable, stimulus-rich housing conditions reached the final learning criterion faster than the sheep from the unpredictable, stimulus-poor conditions, that is, in a median of 17 versus 37 sessions (Mann-Whitney-U test: W = 112.5, p = 0.02), respectively, and they were more likely to do so (12/12 versus 5/12 sheep, respectively; Fishers-exact test: p = 0.005).""
  - ""Compared with sheep from the predictable, stimulus-rich environment, sheep kept in the unpredictable, stimulus-poor housing conditions were less likely and slower in reaching the learning criterion of the cognitive judgement bias test.""",,"- The study involved two groups of sheep: one group was kept in unpredictable, stimulus-poor housing conditions, and the other group was kept in predictable, stimulus-rich housing conditions.
- These two groups were subjected to different housing conditions simultaneously to induce differential mood states, which is indicative of a between-individual study design.
- The study did not involve the same group of animals being subjected to different treatments sequentially; instead, two separate groups were used to compare the effects of different housing conditions.
- The use of two distinct groups (unpredictable, stimulus-poor vs. predictable, stimulus-rich) and the comparison of their performance in the cognitive judgement bias test align with a between-individual study design."
"Measurement of cognitive bias and cortisol levels to evaluate the effects of space restriction on captive collared peccary (Mammalia, Tayassuidae)","Flávia R M Oliveira, Sérgio L G Nogueira-Filho, Maria B C Sousa, Carlos T S Dias, Michael Mendl, Selene S C Nogueira",-,-,,11,2016,Oliveira2016.pdf,within,"  - ""The five housing conditions were, in order: H1 (control-no space restriction), H2 (space restriction without environmental enrichment), H3 (control-no space restriction), H4 (space restriction with environmental enrichment), H5 (control-no space restriction)""
  - ""During the whole experiment (training sessions, housing treatments, and judgement-bias tests), the animals remained in the same pen.""
  - ""The five experimental conditions and accompanying judgement bias tests were implemented in succession such that the experiment ran for 40 consecutive days""
  - ""Individuals were subjected to five 8-day housing conditions in the order: H1 (controlno space restriction-metabolism pen and additional area), H2 space restriction without environmental enrichment (metabolism pen only), H3 (control-no space restriction), H4 (space restriction with environmental enrichment), and H5 (control-no space restriction).""",,"- The study involved a single group of animals that were subjected to different housing conditions sequentially. This is indicated by the phrase ""Individuals were subjected to five 8-day housing conditions in the order,"" which suggests that the same animals went through each condition one after the other.
- The experiment was conducted over 40 consecutive days, with each housing condition lasting 8 days. This sequential approach is characteristic of a within-study design.
- The animals remained in the same pen throughout the experiment, further supporting the idea that the same group of animals was used for all conditions.
- The description of the experimental conditions being implemented in succession also aligns with a within-study design, where the same group of animals is exposed to different treatments in a sequence."
The effects of housing conditions on judgement bias in Japanese quail,"Mária Horváth, Katarína Pichová, L ' Ubor Košt'ál",-,-,,12,2016,Horvàth2016.pdf,"between, within","  - ""The aim of this study was to validate the operant conditioning based cognitive bias test for Japanese quail and investigate the effect of housing conditions (wire cage vs. deep litter pen) on the affective states using this test.""
  - ""In each of the four experiments the animals were divided into the two groups.""
  - ""The length of exposure of each group to different HMs, order of environment exchange and the timeline of behavioural tests is illustrated in Fig. 2""
  - ""In two out of four experiments there were no significant effects of housing on the proportion of responses to the ambiguous stimuli.""
  - ""In one experiment deep litter housed birds responded more to the ambiguous stimuli than the caged ones, but after the exchange of environments the same birds housed in cages still responded more to the ambiguous cue.""
  - ""The Exp1 was the pilot study with small number of birds (Group 1 n = 3, Group 2 n = 3), the aim of which was to test the design of the procedures.""
  - ""The birds were subjected to two series of JBTs, one during the HM1 and another one during the HM2 (see Fig. 2""
  - ""In Exp2 (Group 1 n = 6, Group 2 n = 5), the birds were subjected to three series of JBTs.""
  - ""In Exp3 (Group 1 n = 5, Group 2 n = 4) the quails were subjected to four series of JBTs.""
  - ""In Exp4 (Group 1 n = 10, Group 2 n = 9), the birds were subjected to two series of JBTs, one during the HM1 and another one during the HM2 (Fig. 2""",,"- The study involved dividing animals into two groups, which suggests a between-individual design.
- The mention of ""two groups"" and ""different HMs"" indicates that different groups were exposed to different housing conditions simultaneously.
- The description of experiments where birds were subjected to different series of JBTs under different housing conditions further supports a between-individual design.
- The exchange of environments in some experiments suggests a cross-over design, which is a type of within-individual design.
- The study design includes both between-individual comparisons (different groups in different housing conditions) and within-individual comparisons (same birds in different housing conditions over time)."
Validation of a novel cognitive bias task based on difference in quantity of reinforcement for assessing environmental enrichment,"Heidi A Keen, O Lynne Nelson, Charles T Robbins, Marc Evans, David J Shepherdson, Ruth C Newberry",-,-,-,-,-,Keen2014.pdf,"between, within","  - ""Bears received a total of 6 exposures to each enrichment condition, and order was randomized within blocks controlling for the number of times each condition preceded another.""
  - ""Due to changes in behavior across the 2.1-h session, a single exploratory post hoc analysis per behavior type (stereotypy and engagement with enrichment) was conducted using a Glimmix model to investigate the effect of behavior within time period (beginning, middle, and end) on cognitive bias response.""
  - ""Bears were then exposed to enrichment conditions in the yard in groups of four socially compatible bears (Kio, Peeka, Luna, Mica; Frank, John, Cooke, Oakley), with each 2.1-h 'enrichment condition' session followed by individual cognitive bias testing.""
  - ""The four bears in one group (3 reward group) were rewarded with 3 apple slices for the high-reward behavior, and the four bears in the other group (6 reward group) were rewarded with 6 apple slices, which were fed to the bears through the fence sequentially using caution not to allow our fingers to cross the plane of the fence.""
  - ""We assigned the bears to two age-and sexmatched experimental groups (3 and 6 reward groups, respectively), each comprising two adult females with extensive positive reinforcement training experience (e.g., voluntary blood draws, collaring, and echocardiograms, using honey water as the reinforcement), one adult male with little training experience, and one adult female with no prior training experience.""",,"- The study involved two groups of bears (3 reward group and 6 reward group) that were simultaneously subject to different reward conditions, indicating a between-individual design for Experiment 1.
- In Experiment 2, the same group of bears was exposed to different enrichment conditions sequentially, which suggests a within-individual design for this part of the study.
- The use of randomized order within blocks for enrichment conditions further supports the within-individual design for Experiment 2."
