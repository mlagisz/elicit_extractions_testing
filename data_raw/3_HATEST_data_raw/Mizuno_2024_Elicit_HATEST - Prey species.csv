Body size affects the evolution of eyespots in caterpillars,"Thomas John Hossie, John Skelhorn, Jesse W Breinholt, Akito Y Kawahara, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,50,2015,Hossie_2015.pdf,none,"  - ""We examined the distribution of eyespots among final instar caterpillars of known size.""
  - ""We conducted phylogenetic analyses of hawkmoths in Macroglossinae, the primary subfamily, with extraordinary caterpillar eyespot morphology (20,29), and the most speciose, with more than 800 described species (30).""
  - ""Our examination of hawkmoth caterpillar traits revealed that eyespots generally are more common in species whose larvae attain relatively large body size;""
  - ""Our phylogenetic analysis clearly demonstrates that the evolution of eyespots is associated with large body size, and our field and laboratory experiments provide an explanation for this;""
  - ""Using a phylogenetically controlled analysis of hawkmoth caterpillars, we show that eyespots are associated with large body size.""",,"- The paper focuses on hawkmoth caterpillars, specifically mentioning the subfamily Macroglossinae, which is known for its caterpillars with eyespots.
- The study uses a phylogenetically controlled analysis of hawkmoth caterpillars to explore the relationship between body size and eyespots.
- The paper does not specify a particular Latin binomial name for a single species but rather discusses the general trend across hawkmoth caterpillars.
- The focus is on the trait of eyespots in hawkmoth caterpillars rather than a specific species."
Deflective effect and the effect of prey detectability on anti-predator function of eyespots,"Adrian Vallin, Marina Dimitrova, Ullasa Kodandaramaiah, Sami Merilaita, D Kemp",-,-,Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology,38,2011,Vallin_2011.pdf,none,"  - ""One example of a conspicuous prey color pattern are eyespots that are commonly found on the wings of Lepidoptera but also in other animals such as mollusks, fish, frogs, and birds (Poulton 1890;Blest 1957;Stevens 2005).""
  - ""The deflection hypothesis typically concerns the small eyespots found at the wing margins of many butterflies.""
  - ""In butterflies, the wing margins tear easily and an attack in this area may offer an opportunity for the butterfly to break free and escape without being severely harmed.""
  - ""In our first experiment, in which the eyespot was either on the left or on the right ""wing"" of the triangular prey, we found that the birds more often attacked the side with the eyespot, when the eyespot was small (3 mm).""
  - ""In the second experiment, we focused on the intimidation hypothesis, and presented the predators with paired combinations of prey with one large (6 mm) eyespot or two symmetrically placed, smaller (4 mm) eyespots with equal total area as the large eyespot or with no eyespot at all.""
  - ""Vallin et al. (2007) measured the eyespots of seven peacock butterflies (Inachis io) which elicited a deterring effect on blue tits, and found their diameter to be 6.4±0.5 mm.""",,"- The paper discusses eyespots commonly found on the wings of Lepidoptera, which includes butterflies and moths.
- The experiments involve artificial prey items with eyespots, not actual living prey species.
- The paper mentions butterflies specifically in the context of the deflection hypothesis and the intimidation hypothesis.
- The mention of ""peacock butterflies (Inachis io)"" suggests that this species was used as a reference for eyespot size, but it is not explicitly stated that they were used in the experiment.
- The paper does not specify any particular prey species used in the experiment, only that artificial prey items were used to mimic the effects of eyespots."
Eyespots interact with body colour to protect caterpillar-like prey from avian predators,"Thomas John Hossie, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,Animal Behaviour,37,2012,Hossie_2012.pdf,Papilio canadensis,"  - ""Artificial caterpillars were designed to assess the protective value of eyespots and countershading on caterpillar prey in general; however, for ecological relevance, our prey were modelled loosely on Papilio canadensis.""
  - ""The caterpillars of many lepidopteran species are generally thought to mimic snakes as they possess a pair of eyespots on enlarged anterior body segments during late instars (e.g. Papilio sp., see Scriber et al. 1995;Allen et al. 2005;Wagner 2005 for photos).""
  - ""The entire process was replicated nine times (three times per site, albeit at a different location within site) for a total of 864 artificial prey deployed.""",,"- The paper mentions that the artificial caterpillars were modelled loosely on Papilio canadensis, which is a species of butterfly. This suggests that the prey species used in the experiment was based on this species.
- The paper does not specify any other prey species, so it appears that only Papilio canadensis was used as the basis for the artificial caterpillars.
- The Latin binomial name for the species is provided as Papilio canadensis."
Field experiments on the effectiveness of 'eyespots' as predator deterrents,"Martin Stevens, Elinor Hopkins, William Hinde, Amabel Adcock, Yvonne Connolly, Tom Troscianko, Innes C Cuthill, K T Troscianko",-,-,-,-,-,Stevens_2007.pdf,none,"  - ""Many potential prey species possess features that falsely convey a risk to the predator.""
  - ""Many animals, most notably diurnal lepidopterans, possess 'eyespots': approximately circular markings composed of colours contrasting with the surrounding body area, and often comprising concentric rings.""
  - ""The classic experiment investigating how eyespots function, by Blest (1957), showed that birds were startled and clearly alarmed by the display of the (edible to birds) peacock butterfly Inachis io, which involves the sudden exposure of two pairs of eyespots (one on each wing).""
  - ""Our field experiments used artificial 'moth' targets (as in Cuthill et al. 2005) with specific patterns, to test the effect on the rate of predation of different types of luminance (brightness) contrast patterns.""
  - ""The aim of the second experiment was to investigate the effects of different eyespot component arrangements in spots which possess two elements.""
  - ""The aim of experiment 3 was to determine if there is a difference in the survival value conferred by circular compared to triangular spots.""
  - ""The aim of the fifth experiment was first, to determine if simple spots consisting of one component would be effective in reducing predation compared to uniform grey control targets (as in experiment 1, but with wing luminance midway between black and white on a linear scale), and compared to targets with spots of two components (as in experiment 4).""",,"- The paper discusses the use of artificial ""moth"" targets, which suggests that the experiments were designed to mimic moth-like patterns.
- The mention of ""diurnal lepidopterans"" and ""peacock butterfly Inachis io"" indicates that the study is related to butterflies and moths, but it does not specify a particular species used in the experiments.
- The experiments used artificial targets rather than actual prey species, so there is no specific Latin binomial name of a prey species mentioned in the paper.
- The focus is on the patterns and their effects rather than on specific species."
Significance of butterfly eyespots as an anti-predator device in ground-based and aerial attacks,"Anne Lyytinen, Paul M Brakefield, Johanna Mappes",-,-,,93,2003,Lyytinen_2003.pdf,Bicyclus anynana,"  - ""Bicyclus anynana (Satyrinae) shows variation in number, size, shape, colour composition, and position of eyespots (Brakefield and French 1999).""
  - ""To test the deflection hypothesis, we compared the survival of the spotless dry season form and spotted wet season form of Bicyclus anynana and examined the target of initial strike.""
  - ""To test whether eyespots affect the escape probability of butterflies after the attack, three forms (spotless, spotted, Bigeye-comet) of B. anynana differing in eyespot pattern, were placed one at a time on the slice of banana into the cages in the presence of a lizard.""
  - ""In addition, we used a double mutant line, Bigeye-comet, in which all the eyespots are larger in size than in the wet season form.""
  - ""The wet season form has seven eyespots on its hindwings and two on its forewings (Fig. 1""",,"- The paper specifically mentions the use of ""Bicyclus anynana"" as the prey species in the experiment.
- The experiment involved different forms of B. anynana, including spotless, spotted, and Bigeye-comet, which are variations of the same species.
- The focus of the study was on the effects of eyespots on the escape probability of B. anynana when attacked by predators."
The Feeding Behaviour of Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) in the Presence of 'Eyes',"I R Inglis, L W Huson, M B Marshall, P A Arid,  Neville",-,-,-,-,-,Inglis_1983.pdf,Aglais urticae,"  - ""BLEST (1957) demonstrated in experiments involving the predation of Aglais urticae by yellow buntings (Emberiza citrinefla) and reed buntings (Emberiza schoenicufus), how essential the patterns are in such defence.""
  - ""BLEST (1957, p. 253) suggested the ""intimidating eyespots act by mimicking the eyes of the large avian predators"" and that the response is probably inborn.""
  - ""In butterflies whose eyespots had been removed, the display movements themselves elicited no flight responses in the birds.""
  - ""The wings of many insects bear circular patterns, ""eyespots"" which resemble the vertebrate eye.""",,"- The paper discusses the use of eye-like patterns to deter birds, specifically starlings, from feeding. It references studies involving butterflies and their eye-spots as a defense mechanism against predators.
- The mention of ""Aglais urticae"" in the context of BLEST's experiments indicates that this species was used in studies related to the effect of eye-spots on bird behavior.
- The paper does not specify any other prey species beyond ""Aglais urticae,"" which is a butterfly species known for its eye-spots."
The position of eyespots and thickened segments influence their protective value to caterpillars,"John Skelhorn, Giles Dorrington, Thomas J Hossie, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,,16,2014,Skelhorn_2014.pdf,"Papilio canadensis, Papilio glaucus","  - ""Artificial caterpillars were designed to assess whether the position of either eyespots or the thickened body segments associated with the defensive posture, influenced their antipredatory benefit.""
  - ""We chose to do this for a number of reasons: because eyespots have been found to be more effective deterrents when placed on countershaded caterpillars (Hossie and Sherratt 2012); to maintain a degree of ecological relevance; and so that our findings could be more directly compared with those of Hossie and Sherratt (2013).""
  - ""We used the same pastry recipes as Hossie and Sherratt (40 mL of lard, 118 mL of flour, and either 3 drops of Leaf Green food dye in 20 mL of water to produce light green pastry or 6 drops of the same dye in 15 mL of water to produce dark green pastry), and identical ingredients, dyes, and paints (shipped to the United Kingdom from Canada). Countershaded prey with dark dorsal and light ventral sides (4 cm long with a diameter of ≈0.7 cm) was produced by pressing together dark and light pastry cylinders (4 cm long with a diameter of ≈0.5 cm).""
  - ""The larvae of a number of Lepidoptera species possess eyespots on either their anterior or posterior segments and inflate these segments when attacked by predators""",,"- The paper discusses the use of artificial caterpillars to study the effect of eyespots and thickened body segments on predator wariness.
- The artificial caterpillars were designed to resemble the late instars of Papilio canadensis and Papilio glaucus caterpillars, as indicated by the use of similar pastry recipes and the mention of countershaded prey.
- The paper does not specify a single Latin binomial name for the prey species used in the experiment, but it implies that the artificial caterpillars were modeled after Papilio species."
"The protective value of conspicuous signals is not impaired by shape, size, or position asymmetry","Martin Stevens, Sarah A Castor-Perry, Jessica R F Price",-,-,,19,2009,Stevens&CastorPerry_2009.pdf,none,"  - ""In both experiments, and in line with previous work (Stevens et al. 2007; Stevens, Hardman, and Stubbins 2008) , simple continuously visible markings enhanced the survival of conspicuous artificial prey in the field.""
  - ""Previous work has shown that wing spots can switch from being beneficial to costly and increase predation compared with unmarked controls when the targets match the background lightness (Stevens, Stubbins, and Hardman 2008)""
  - ""The experiment followed the same overall procedure as Stevens et al. (2007) and Stevens, Hardman, and Stubbins (2008) , with gray-scale artificial ''prey,'' 76 mm wide and 38 mm high, made from triangular pieces of waterproof paper""
  - ""We undertook 2 field experiments with artificial gray-scale prey, marked with a pair of white markings presented to wild avian predators, to test the effect of asymmetry on the survival value of conspicuous signals in the field.""",,"- The paper describes the use of ""artificial gray-scale prey"" and ""gray-scale artificial 'prey'"" in the experiments, indicating that the prey used were not real species but artificial models.
- The experiments involved ""artificial palatable prey presented to wild avian predators,"" which suggests that the prey were not specific species but rather artificial constructs designed to test the effects of conspicuous signals.
- There is no mention of any specific prey species, such as butterflies, moths, or caterpillars, in the paper. The focus is on the artificial prey models used in the experiments.
- The paper does not provide any Latin binomial names for prey species, as it does not involve real species in the experiments."
