Mechanisms of Social Influence: A Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Social Information on Female Mate Choice Decisions,"Blake Carlton Jones, Emily H Duval",-,-,Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution,35,2019,Jones_2019.pdf,Odds Ratio,"  - ""we extracted effect sizes as odds ratios (OR) with the following formula:

A is the number of female observers exposed to a model's choice that chose the same male or male phenotype. Similarly, B is the number of observers exposed to a model's choice that did not copy it. C is the number of control females (i.e., females that did not witness the model's choice) that made the same choice as the model. D is the number of controls that did not choose the same as the model.""
  - ""We used the natural log of the OR [ln(OR)] to normalize the distribution of the data.""

  - ""We calculated 103 effect sizes from 40 published studies of mate-choice copying that met our selection criteria.""
  - ""We used a metaanalytic approach that allowed us to control for non-independent data due to phylogenetic relationships, taxonomy, and multiple experiments conducted during the same study.""
