Built environmental correlates of older adults' total physical activity and walking: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"David W Barnett, Anthony Barnett, Andrea Nathan, Jelle Van Cauwenberg, Ester Cerin",-,-,-,-,-,Barnett_2017.pdf,quantitative,"  - ""The aim of this study was to first systematically review and quantify findings on built environmental correlates of older adults' PA, and second, investigate differences by type of PA and environmental attribute measurement.""
  - ""Findings were meta-analysed and weighted by article quality and sample size and then stratified by PA and environmental measurement method.""
  - ""a meta-analytic approach was applied to define conservative estimates of p-values for each examined combination of environmental attribute and PA outcome""
  - ""Associations of specific built environmental attributes with PA outcomes were examined by type of PA and environmental measurement (objective and perceived) only when ≥3 articles provided data on each type of measure,""
  - ""Due to the large range of different environmental and PA measures reported in the selected articles, it was not possible to conduct a 'traditional' meta-analysis involving the estimation of pooled effect sizes and their 95% confidence intervals.""
  - ""To perform the meta-analyses, we first assigned a zvalue to each separate built environmental attribute and PA finding, specifically: 1.96 for a positive; -1.96 for a negative; and 0 for a nil finding""
  - ""We then calculated a summary two-tailed p-value using Rosenthal's approach""
  - ""This systematic review and meta-analysis has several strengths. It addressed publication bias by including both peer-reviewed scientific articles and grey literature. It provided a quantitative synthesis of associations based on non-standardised environmental and PA measurement instruments and stratified findings by measurement types.""",,"- The paper explicitly states that it conducted a meta-analysis, which is a quantitative synthesis method. This is indicated by phrases such as ""Findings were meta-analysed"" and ""A meta-analytic approach was applied.""
- The paper also mentions that it used a meta-analytic approach to define conservative estimates of p-values, which is a statistical synthesis of results.
- The use of z-values and Rosenthal's approach for calculating summary p-values further supports the quantitative nature of the synthesis.
- The paper does not solely rely on a narrative summary but instead uses statistical methods to combine evidence, which aligns with a quantitative synthesis.
- The paper also provides a narrative summary of the results, as indicated by the discussion of findings and implications, which suggests a combination of quantitative and qualitative synthesis."
Economic analysis of the health impacts of housing improvement studies: a systematic review,"Elisabeth Fenwick, Catriona Macdonald, Hilary Thomson",-,-,Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health,35,2013,Fenwick_2013.pdf,qualitative,"  - ""The reported data were assessed for their suitability to economic evaluation.""

  - ""The paper uses these data to examine the economics of housing investment and also to reflect on the current state of health economic analysis in housing.""
  - ""Findings from the studies which report costs only, suggest that fuel costs may reduce following provision of warmth and energy efficiency improvements, and that rents may increase following housing improvement.""
  - ""The three studies which presented a 'balance-sheet' approach reported a positive net economic benefit following the intervention, based on the outcomes valued in monetary terms.""

  - ""NS is a method of systematic review enabling investigation of research questions with potentially broad informing subject areas (Popay et al., 2006)""
  - ""NS relies primarily on textual description to summarise findings of multiple types of studies, and can involve mapping these against a conceptual framework ( Leamy et al., 2011).""
  - ""The selection of NS for use in this study reflects the need to create thematic coherence among data sets (both qualitative and quantitative), in order to categorise key areas of challenge and relevant solutions, in a largely unexplored, interdisciplinary area.""
  - ""NS consists of three steps designed to ensure optimal transparency and robustness; these are developing a theory of change, developing a preliminary synthesis, exploring relationships within and between studies, and assessing the robustness of the synthesis (Arai et al., 2007).""
  - ""The NS approach was used in order to analyse the complex multidisciplinary nature of the research topic, and the current lack of cohesive data structures within it, problems impeding focused policy solutions in this area thus far (Victor, 2008;Pierce & Paulos, 2012).""
  - ""NS's thematic synthesis is extremely useful in that is allows us to clearly address major opportunities, difficulties and risks involved with sustainable energy engagement processes in the context of the contemporary information economy by presenting broad causal relationships, while also providing specific practical guidance concerning practical implementation of solutions, as gleaned from the relevant literature (see Popay et al., 2006, ""conceptual models"", p. 20)""
  - ""A potential limitation of this method is that outcomes will not reflect the complete range of possibilities and risks related to interactive media engagement and sustainability. It should be recognised that the systematic review does not offer a complete picture or a set of discrete answers, but rather a partial picture, and that the theoretical insights are meant to add to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the reported results (Popay, 2006)""
  - ""NS also poses a limitation concerning consistency in identifying relevant findings and studies. As the first systematic review on the topic of interactive engagement with sustainable energy, analysis and outcomes are presented as indicative rather than comprehensive.""",,"- The paper explicitly states that it uses a Narrative Synthesis (NS) framework, which is a qualitative method of systematic review.
- NS relies on textual description to summarize findings, indicating a qualitative approach.
- The paper mentions that NS involves mapping findings against a conceptual framework, but this does not imply a quantitative synthesis.
- The steps involved in NS include developing a theory of change, preliminary synthesis, exploring relationships, and assessing robustness, all of which are qualitative in nature.
- The paper does not mention any statistical synthesis or meta-analysis, which would be indicative of a quantitative approach.
- The focus on thematic coherence and categorization of challenges and solutions further supports the qualitative nature of the synthesis."

- The use of summary codes such as '+' for positive associations and '-' for negative associations indicates a systematic and quantitative approach to synthesizing the results of individual studies.
- The paper mentions that study results were coded and summarized, which aligns with a quantitative synthesis method.

  - ""On the other hand, the experimental studies presented confl icting evidence: Joynt and Kang [35] concluded that vegetation did not effectively reduce perception of noise, Maffei et al. [36] observed some effect but their results were inconclusive and Yang et al. [9] objectively proved that the buffering effect of vegetation was signifi cant.""
  - ""We found consistent evidence among the observational studies about the attenuation effects of vegetation: The two cross-sectional (one high quality and one moderate quality) studies found that green areas could buffer the effects of chronic noise exposure on annoyance responses.""",,"- The paper explicitly states that due to the heterogeneity of the included studies, a qualitative assessment was performed. This indicates that the synthesis method did not involve statistical synthesis of results, which would be characteristic of a quantitative approach.
- The paper provides a narrative summary of the results of included studies, discussing the findings of each study and their implications. This is typical of a qualitative synthesis.
- There is no mention of any statistical synthesis or meta-analysis being conducted, which would be necessary for a quantitative or qualitative + quantitative approach.
- The paper does not use maps or tables to summarize the results of individual studies in a way that would qualify as a ""map"" synthesis method."
