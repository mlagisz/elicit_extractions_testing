Body size affects the evolution of eyespots in caterpillars,"Thomas John Hossie, John Skelhorn, Jesse W Breinholt, Akito Y Kawahara, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,50,2015,Hossie_2015.pdf,artificial,"  - ""To examine the relationship between the possession of eyespots and body size in extant species, a phylogenetically controlled analysis is essential to conservatively control for any lack of independence of species data arising through shared ancestry (27,28).""
  - ""To evaluate these hypotheses, we exposed small and large caterpillar models with and without eyespots in a 2 × 2 factorial design to avian predators in the field.""
  - ""Artificial caterpillars were designed to quantify the selective advantage of eyespots on large and small prey.""
  - ""The caterpillar models in our field experiment comprised four treatments: small-no eyespots, large-no eyespots, small-eyespots, and largeeyespots.""
  - ""Eyespots were hand-painted onto pastry caterpillars using Elmer's Nontoxic Tempera Paint (Elmer's Products).""
  - ""The design of artificial prey for the laboratory presentations to domestic chicks was slightly modified to allow the inclusion of two additional treatments to account for a possible confounding effect of eyespot size.""",,"- The paper describes the use of ""caterpillar models"" and ""artificial caterpillars"" in both field and laboratory experiments, indicating that the prey used were not real caterpillars but rather artificial representations.
- The materials used to create these artificial caterpillars are detailed, such as a mixture of flour and lard, and eyespots were hand-painted onto these models.
- The experiments involved manipulating body size and eyespot size on these artificial models, further supporting that the prey were not real but artificial.
- The use of terms like ""artificial caterpillars"" and ""pastry caterpillars"" consistently throughout the paper confirms that the prey material type was artificial."
Deflective effect and the effect of prey detectability on anti-predator function of eyespots,"Adrian Vallin, Marina Dimitrova, Ullasa Kodandaramaiah, Sami Merilaita, D Kemp",-,-,Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology,38,2011,Vallin_2011.pdf,artificial,"  - ""In two experiments, we used artificial, triangular prey items and blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) as predators.""
  - ""we used artificial backgrounds and prey items that made it possible for us to fully control for the degree of background matching of the prey.""
  - ""The prey items were isosceles triangular (b × h: 30×15 mm 2 ), and their grey ground color was identical to the grey of the concealing background (Fig. 1b, c""",,"- The paper explicitly states that ""artificial, triangular prey items"" were used in the experiments. This indicates that the prey was not a real butterfly or moth but rather a geometrically designed artificial model.
- The description of the prey items as ""isosceles triangular"" and made of ""printed paper"" further supports the conclusion that they were artificial.
- The use of ""artificial backgrounds"" and the manipulation of these backgrounds to control for background matching also suggests that the entire setup was artificial."
Eyespots interact with body colour to protect caterpillar-like prey from avian predators,"Thomas John Hossie, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,Animal Behaviour,37,2012,Hossie_2012.pdf,artificial,"  - ""We created artificial prey following similar protocols to previous studies (e.g. Church et al. 1997;Rowland et al. 2008).""
  - ""Artificial caterpillars were designed to assess the protective value of eyespots and countershading on caterpillar prey in general; however, for ecological relevance, our prey were modelled loosely on Papilio canadensis.""
  - ""We assessed the protective value of caterpillar eyespots with and without a form of countershading by pinning artificial caterpillars to tree branches in the field and monitoring their survival over 90 h.""
  - ""Finished pastry caterpillars (e.g. Fig. 1 ) were checked against a standard model prey for each treatment to ensure uniformity in size and shape of the body, as well as the size and position of eyespots.""",,"- The paper explicitly states that ""artificial caterpillars"" were used in the study, indicating that the prey material was not real but rather created for experimental purposes.
- The artificial caterpillars were made from a mixture of flour and lard, which further supports that they were not real biological organisms.
- The design of the artificial caterpillars was based on the species Papilio canadensis, but they were not actual specimens of this species or any other real butterfly/moth/caterpillar.
- The use of the term ""artificial"" and the description of the materials used to create the caterpillars clearly indicate that the prey type was artificial."
Field experiments on the effectiveness of 'eyespots' as predator deterrents,"Martin Stevens, Elinor Hopkins, William Hinde, Amabel Adcock, Yvonne Connolly, Tom Troscianko, Innes C Cuthill, K T Troscianko",-,-,-,-,-,Stevens_2007.pdf,artificial,"  - ""For all experiments, artificial moth-like stimuli (not designed to mimic any real species) were made from triangular pieces of waterproof card""
  - ""Here, we use a field technique involving artificial moth-like stimuli, with or without different forms of grey-scale eyespots, to test these two opposing hypotheses.""
  - ""Our field experiments used artificial 'moth' targets (as in Cuthill et al. 2005) with specific patterns, to test the effect on the rate of predation of different types of luminance (brightness) contrast patterns.""
  - ""The moth targets used in our study required calibration before printing because a printer's grey-scale (here 8-bit, or 0e255) is not linearly related to perceived luminance even for a human, far less a bird""",,"- The paper explicitly states that the authors used ""artificial moth-like stimuli"" and ""artificial 'moth' targets"" in their experiments. This indicates that the prey material was not a real butterfly or moth but rather a constructed, simplified representation.
- The stimuli were not designed to mimic any real species, which further supports the conclusion that the prey material was artificial.
- The use of ""triangular pieces of waterproof card"" and the need for calibration to simulate perceived luminance also suggest that the prey material was not a real biological specimen but rather a manufactured, artificial construct."
Significance of butterfly eyespots as an anti-predator device in ground-based and aerial attacks,"Anne Lyytinen, Paul M Brakefield, Johanna Mappes",-,-,,93,2003,Lyytinen_2003.pdf,real,"  - ""In our experiments, lizards and birds preyed upon butterflies which were at rest or feeding on a banana slice, and hence the possible differences in activity levels or escape efficiency of butterfly forms did not influence the results.""
  - ""Bicyclus anynana (Satyrinae) shows variation in number, size, shape, colour composition, and position of eyespots (Brakefield and French 1999).""
  - ""The live butterflies were presented to them whilst feeding on a piece of banana slice such that any possible differences in the behaviour between butterfly forms could not influence the result.""
  - ""We used two model predators: lizards (Anolis carolinensis) and pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) that are visually hunting insectivorous predators.""
  - ""To test the deflection hypothesis, we compared the survival of the spotless dry season form and spotted wet season form of Bicyclus anynana and examined the target of initial strike.""",,"- The paper discusses the use of live butterflies of the species Bicyclus anynana in experiments to test the deflection hypothesis.
- The experiments involved presenting these live butterflies to predators, indicating that real butterflies were used as prey.
- The paper does not mention the use of artificial or simplified patterns; instead, it focuses on the natural variation in eyespot patterns of Bicyclus anynana.
- The use of real butterflies is further supported by the description of the butterflies' behavior and the experimental setup, which involved feeding on banana slices."
The Feeding Behaviour of Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) in the Presence of 'Eyes',"I R Inglis, L W Huson, M B Marshall, P A Arid,  Neville",-,-,-,-,-,Inglis_1983.pdf,artificial,"  - ""The starling (Sturnus vulgaris) was the subject species.""
  - ""The experimental procedure was designed to provide a relevant and objective, interval scale of aversiveness based upon the ability of eye patterns to deter hungry birds from a feeding area.""
  - ""Simple eye-like patterns can indeed deter hungry starlings from feeding in their vicinity.""
  - ""The presence of a pair of eyes painted on a white card caused a n 88 % reduction in time spent on the nearby food trough and a 65 % reduction in actual feeding time.""
  - ""The presence of 'pupils' in the patterns is essential for simple circles alone are not significantly more aversivc than the control card.""
  - ""Eyes with coloured irises are more effective than black and white patterns but the degree of contrast between the 'pupil' and 'iris' appears irrelevant.""
  - ""Increasing the number of simultaneously presented eyes from one to three is correlated with an increasing trend in aversiveness which is destroyed combination while, although there were no significant differences within these""
  - ""The aversive properties of eyespots and of broadcast starling distress calls are positively additive.""
  - ""The effectiveness of a stimulus combining all the important features mentioned is as aversive as is a realistic model of the head of an owl.""",,"- The paper focuses on the aversive properties of eye-like patterns on starlings, not on real butterflies, moths, or caterpillars.
- The experiments involved geometric patterns such as circles and triangles to represent eyes, rather than using real or modified patterns from butterflies or moths.
- The paper discusses the use of artificial stimuli like painted eyes on cards, which are not derived from real butterfly or moth species.
- The focus is on the aversiveness of these artificial patterns to starlings, indicating that the prey material type is artificial."
The position of eyespots and thickened segments influence their protective value to caterpillars,"John Skelhorn, Giles Dorrington, Thomas J Hossie, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,,16,2014,Skelhorn_2014.pdf,artificial,"  - ""our artificial caterpillars were immobile, and yet, many caterpillars react behaviorally when approached by predators.""
  - ""To differentiate between these contrasting explanations, we evaluated the responses of naive chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus) to artificial caterpillar-like prey.""
  - ""Artificial caterpillars were designed to assess whether the position of either eyespots or the thickened body segments associated with the defensive posture, influenced their antipredatory benefit.""
  - ""Countershaded prey with dark dorsal and light ventral sides (4 cm long with a diameter of ≈0.7 cm) was produced by pressing together dark and light pastry cylinders (4 cm long with a diameter of ≈0.5 cm).""
  - ""We followed Hossie and Sherratt's (2013) method of producing countershaded pastry caterpillars based loosely on the appearance of the late instars of Papilio canadensis and Papilio glaucus caterpillars.""",,"- The paper explicitly states that the authors used ""artificial caterpillar-like prey"" and ""artificial caterpillars,"" indicating that the prey was not real but rather created for the experiment.
- The description of the prey as ""countershaded pastry caterpillars"" further supports that the prey was artificial, as it was made from pastry.
- The mention that the artificial caterpillars were ""based loosely on the appearance of the late instars of Papilio canadensis and Papilio glaucus caterpillars"" suggests that while they were inspired by real species, they were not actual specimens or direct patterning of real species.
- The use of pastry to create the caterpillars and the description of them as ""immobile"" also indicates that they were not real, living organisms."
"The protective value of conspicuous signals is not impaired by shape, size, or position asymmetry","Martin Stevens, Sarah A Castor-Perry, Jessica R F Price",-,-,,19,2009,Stevens&CastorPerry_2009.pdf,artificial,"  - ""In both experiments, and in line with previous work (Stevens et al. 2007; Stevens, Hardman, and Stubbins 2008) , simple continuously visible markings enhanced the survival of conspicuous artificial prey in the field.""
  - ""We undertook 2 field experiments with artificial gray-scale prey, marked with a pair of white markings presented to wild avian predators, to test the effect of asymmetry on the survival value of conspicuous signals in the field.""
  - ""The experiment followed the same overall procedure as Stevens et al. (2007) and Stevens, Hardman, and Stubbins (2008) , with gray-scale artificial ''prey,'' 76 mm wide and 38 mm high, made from triangular pieces of waterproof paper (HP LaserJet Tough Paper, Palo Alto, CA).""",,"- The paper explicitly states that the prey used in the experiments were ""artificial gray-scale prey"" and ""gray-scale artificial 'prey,'"" indicating that they were not real butterflies or moths but rather artificial constructs.
- The description of the prey as being made from ""triangular pieces of waterproof paper"" further supports the conclusion that they were artificial.
- The use of terms like ""artificial prey"" and ""gray-scale artificial 'prey'"" throughout the paper consistently indicates that the prey were not real organisms but rather artificial models."
