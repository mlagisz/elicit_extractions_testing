Artificial light at night affects brain plasticity and melatonin in birds,"Stan Moaraf, Yulia Vistoropsky, Tatyana Pozner, Rachel Heiblum, Monika Okuliarová, Michal Zeman, Anat Barnea",-,-,Neuroscience Letters,49,2019,Moaraf_2019.pdf,yes,"  - ""ALAN disrupted sleep in blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) [14] and led to increased mortality in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) [15].""
  - ""To this end, zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) were exposed to ecologically relevant ALAN intensities (0.5, 1.5 and 5 lx), treated with BrdU to quantify cell proliferation in their ventricular zone (VZ), and compared to controls that were kept under dark nights.""
  - ""MEL levels were measured by sensitive radioimmunoassay and the concentrations recorded in our control group are comparable to previously published data [63]. In all groups that were exposed to ALAN, MEL levels during the night were lower compared to the control group that was exposed to dark nights. Our data are in line with the MEL suppression previously observed in great tits [37], although in that study it was found only at the higher light intensity (5 lx).""

- The scientific name for the mice is not explicitly provided, but it is mentioned as ""adult albino mice of AKR strain,"" which is a common laboratory strain of mice.

LIGHT AT NIGHT CANNOT SUPPRESS PINEAL MELATONIN LEVELS IN THE LIZARD ANOLZS CAROLZNENSZS,Herbert Underwcod,-,-,-,-,-,Underwood_1986.pdf,yes,"  - ""Corresponding studies on the acute effects of light at night on pineal melatonin levels or NAT activity in poikilotherms are lacking. One previous study in the iguanid lizard Anolis carolinensis, however, suggested that the pineal's response to light at night may be qualitatively different from that observed in birds and mammals""
  - ""The present study was undertaken to discriminate between these two possibilities by observing the effects of high intensity (natural and artificial) light pulses on night time pineal melatonin levels in Anolis.""",,"- The paper specifically mentions ""Anolis carolinensis"" as the species being studied. This is the scientific name for the green anole lizard.
- The study focuses on the effects of light on pineal melatonin levels in this species, indicating that it is the primary species of interest in the paper."

  - ""The effects of spectral B:R and R:B regimes on activity behavior and physiology in the present study, may be due to the activation of different groups of deep brain photoreceptor cells, with possibly different photopigment characteristics [32] during the subjective times of day and night, as per the initial 12L:12D regime [13,24].""
  - ""Buntings and weaverbirds interpreted short (blue) and long (red) light wavelengths applied at equal energy levels in a 12 h:12 h cycle as the day and night, respectively, with high activity during the blue and low or no activity during the red light period, except when buntings were in the migratory state and exhibited Zugunruhe in red light 'night' period (cf.
