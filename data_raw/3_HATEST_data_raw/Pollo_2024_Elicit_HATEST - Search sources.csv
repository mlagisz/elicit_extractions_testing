,"Luis M Torres-Vila, Michael D Jennions, A Cockburn",-,-,-,-,-,Torres-Vila_2005.pdf,No search sources found,"  - ""We consulted scientific literature databases, the Internet and previous reviews on this and related topics (Ridley 1988;Vahed 1998;Arnqvist and Nilsson 2000;Torres-Vila et al. 2004) to compile data from 29 studies of 25 Lepidopteran species that related female reproductive output to male mating history (Table 1""",,"- The paper mentions that the authors consulted ""scientific literature databases, the Internet and previous reviews"" to gather data. This indicates that they used online databases and other sources to search for relevant studies.
- The specific names of the databases or sources are not explicitly listed in the provided text, but the mention of ""scientific literature databases"" suggests that they likely used academic databases.
- The phrase ""previous reviews"" implies that they also considered existing reviews on related topics, which could include other academic sources or databases.
- Since the names of specific databases or sources are not provided, it is not possible to list them as required by the question format."
Assortative Mating in Animals,"Yuexin Jiang, Daniel I Bolnick, Mark Kirkpatrick",-,-,American Naturalist,367,2013,Jiang_2013.pdf,"Google Scholar, JSTOR, Web of Science","  - ""We searched for publications reporting suitable measures of assortative mating, using keywords searches in multiple databases, including Google Scholar, JSTOR, and Web of Science.""
  - ""We also examined the reference sections of relevant publications to find additional studies.""",,"- The paper explicitly mentions the use of ""Google Scholar, JSTOR, and Web of Science"" as databases for keyword searches.
- The mention of examining reference sections of relevant publications indicates a secondary method of finding studies, but it does not specify additional databases beyond the primary ones listed.
- The question asks for online databases and other sources used in searches, which are clearly identified in the paper."
Darwinian sex roles confirmed across the animal kingdom,"Tim Janicke, Ines K Häderer, Marc J Lajeunesse, Nils Anthes",-,-,Science Advances,328,2016,Janicke_2016.pdf,Web of Science,"  - ""We first identified relevant studies from ISI Web of Knowledge (Web of Science Core Collection, from 1900 to 2014) with the ""topic"" search terms defined as (""Bateman*"" OR ""opportunit* for selection"" OR ""opportunit* for sexual selection"" OR ""selection gradient*"").""
  - ""This literature search was initiated on 6 December 2012 and repeated on 25 April 2015.""
  - ""The systematic literature search largely followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement (44).""",,"- The paper mentions that the literature search was conducted using the ""ISI Web of Knowledge (Web of Science Core Collection, from 1900 to 2014)."" This is the primary source used for the search.
- The search terms used were specific to the topic of sexual selection and Bateman metrics, indicating a focused search within this database.
- The paper does not mention any other online databases or sources used in the search, so we only have this one source to report."
Measuring and interpreting sexual selection metrics: evaluation and guidelines,"Nils Anthes, Ines K H € Aderer, Nico K Michiels, Tim Janicke",-,-,,42,2017,Anthes_2017.pdf,No search sources found,"  - ""We expect this meta-analytical review to aid future studies in providing less biased and more informative estimates of sexual selection.""
  - ""We scrutinize the quantification of (sex differences in) sexual selection metrics with respect to three components: the underlying study design (section 'Study design'), data collection (section 'Data collection'), and parameter estimation (section 'Parameter estimation').""
  - ""Drawing from a recent meta-analysis, we evaluate potential biases arising from study design, data collection and parameter estimation, and provide suggestions to mitigate such biases in future studies.""",,"- The paper mentions a ""recent meta-analysis"" and a ""meta-analysis database"" which suggests that the authors conducted a systematic review of existing literature.
- The paper does not explicitly mention any specific online databases or search sources used for the meta-analysis.
- The focus of the paper is on evaluating biases and providing guidelines for future studies, rather than detailing the search process or sources used for the meta-analysis."
Mechanisms of Social Influence: A Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Social Information on Female Mate Choice Decisions,"Blake Carlton Jones, Emily H Duval",-,-,Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution,35,2019,Jones_2019.pdf,Web of Science,"  - ""We conducted a meta-analysis of empirical studies quantifying mate-choice copying in non-human animals. We identified relevant studies using a topic search in Web of Science (ISI Thomas Reuters) specifying the search criteria as: TS""
  - ""targeting peer-reviewed research published between 1900 and May 2019.""",,"- The paper explicitly mentions that the authors used ""Web of Science (ISI Thomas Reuters)"" as the source for their topic search.
- The search criteria are detailed, indicating that the authors used specific keywords to identify relevant studies.
- There is no mention of any other databases or sources being used for the search."
No evidence of immediate fitness benefits of within-season divorce in monogamous birds,"Antica Culina, Lyanne Brouwer",-,-,Biology Letters,5,2022,Culina_2022.pdf,No search sources found,"  - ""The syntax was adjusted according to the search functionality of each platform: the details on the complete syntaxes (used for each database) can be found in the electronic supplementary materials, Methods.""
  - ""We conducted a systematic literature search for studies published in English via 15 online databases/search platforms (see electronic supplementary material, Methods) in March 2022.""
  - ""The search syntax included three main components that were designed to describe: (a) pair-bond dynamics and renesting (e.g. 'mate change' OR renest × OR 'mate retention'); (b) breeding success (e.g. 'breeding success' OR 'breeding output'); (c) that breeding attempts were within the same breeding season (e.g. 'within the season' OR 'within a year*').""",,"- The paper mentions that a systematic literature search was conducted using 15 online databases/search platforms, but it does not specify the names of these sources in the main text.
- The details about the search syntax and the specific databases used are referred to as being available in the electronic supplementary materials, which are not included in the provided text.
- Since the names of the specific databases or search sources are not listed in the provided text, we cannot determine the exact sources used for the search."
The relative importance of size and asymmetry in sexual selection,"R Thornhid', A P M0ller, A P Moller",-,-,,88,1998,Thornhill_1998.pdf,No search sources found,"  - ""The data set used for the present study is from Mailer and Thornhill (1998), which was based on (1) a comprehensive search of the literature and of the Internet for information on the relationship between asymmetry and sexual selection, and (2) correspondence between the authors and behavioral ecologists conducting research on this relationship.""",,"- The paper mentions that the data set was based on a ""comprehensive search of the literature and of the Internet,"" but it does not specify any particular databases or sources used in the search.
- The mention of ""correspondence between the authors and behavioral ecologists"" suggests that some information may have been gathered through personal communication, but again, no specific databases or sources are named.
- Since the paper does not provide specific names of databases or sources used in the search, the answer should reflect that no specific search sources were found."
Variation in pre-and post-copulatory sexual selection on male genital size in two species of lygaeid bug,"Liam R Dougherty, David M Shuker",-,-,Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology,18,2016,Dougherty_2016.pdf,No search sources found,"  - ""The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00265-016-2082-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.""
  - ""The strength of post-copulatory sexual selection on processus length in L. simulans across these different studies was estimated using formal meta-analysis.""
  - ""The variancestandardised linear or quadratic selection gradient was used as the effect size.""
  - ""Selection gradients were calculated using univariate regression models, i.e. models do not include covariates (but they do include both linear and quadratic terms).""
  - ""Analyses were performed separately for the linear and quadratic selection gradients.""
  - ""The mean effect size estimate was considered to be significantly different from zero if the 95 % confidence intervals did not include zero.""
  - ""The I 2 statistic was used to determine the amount of heterogeneity in effect sizes across studies; this gives the percentage of variation in effect sizes due to heterogeneity rather than by chance (Higgins et al. 2003).""
  - ""Finally, a mixedeffects meta-analytic model (random-effects model with a categorical fixed factor: Nakagawa and Santos 2012) was used to test if the mean effect size for each type of selection differed due to study author, and a meta-regression model was used to test if effect size was significantly affected by study year.""
  - ""This analysis was performed in R 3.0.1 (R Development Core Team 2014) using the Metafor package (Viechtbauer 2010).""",,"- The paper mentions the use of formal meta-analysis to estimate the strength of post-copulatory sexual selection on processus length in L. simulans. This suggests that the authors conducted a systematic review or meta-analysis, which typically involves searching multiple databases.
- The paper references specific statistical methods and software used for the analysis, such as R and the Metafor package, but it does not explicitly mention the databases or search sources used for the meta-analysis.
- The paper does not provide a list of specific databases or search sources used in the study, which is what is typically required to answer this question.
- The mention of supplementary material and the use of meta-analysis implies that some form of literature search was conducted, but the specific sources are not detailed in the text."
