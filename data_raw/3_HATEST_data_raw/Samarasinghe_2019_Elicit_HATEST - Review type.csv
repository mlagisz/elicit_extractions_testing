  - ""The systematic review presented here builds on a wellestablished methodology originating from the health and social sciences""
  - ""A systematic review of latent heat storage in building elements was conducted to establish the current knowledge base and reveal key design and performance factors that could be used to define technologies available for immediate implementation and for specific applications.""
  - ""This study is different from these preceding reviews in that it encompasses and critically evaluates all relevant literature to date, whilst also addressing data quality and availability issues.""",,"- The paper explicitly states that it is a ""systematic review"" in the abstract and throughout the text.
- The methodology described aligns with the characteristics of a systematic review, including a comprehensive search of literature and critical evaluation of data quality and availability.

Online engagement for sustainable energy projects: A Systematic review and framework for integration,Danielle Barrios-O'neill,-,-,,34,2016,Barrios-ONeill_2016.pdf,systematic review,"  - ""NS is a method of systematic review enabling investigation of research questions with potentially broad informing subject areas (Popay et al., 2006)""
  - ""Toward this aim a systematic literature review was conducted, consulting discourse and practices from planning, energy and infrastructure, marketing, public engagement and consultation policy, and interactive media engagement.""
  - ""The selection of NS for use in this study reflects the need to create thematic coherence among data sets (both qualitative and quantitative), in order to categorise key areas of challenge and relevant solutions, in a largely unexplored, interdisciplinary area.""
  - ""This study was carried out according to a Narrative Synthesis (NS) framework using a process developed originally by Popay et al. (2006) and further refined by Roen et al. (2006), Arai et al. (2007), and Rodgers et al. (2009)""
  - ""This paper investigates current and imminent challenges to supporting transitional energy behaviours among consumers, foregrounding the potentials of strategic interactive media engagement in the sustainable energy sector.""",,"- The paper explicitly states that it conducted a ""systematic literature review,"" which indicates that it is a systematic review.
- The use of a ""Narrative Synthesis (NS) framework"" further supports that it is a systematic review, as NS is a method used in systematic reviews to synthesize findings from multiple studies.
- There is no mention of a meta-analysis or meta-regression in the paper, which would involve statistical analysis of data from multiple studies.
- The focus on thematic coherence and categorization of challenges and solutions aligns with the goals of a systematic review rather than a meta-analysis."
