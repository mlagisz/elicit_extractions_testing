  - ""We calculated mean effect sizes weighted for sample size (sampling variance) using MetaWin 2.0 (Rosenberg et al. 2000).""
  - ""We ran random effects models that allow for a true random component, in addition to sampling error, as a source of variation in effect size among studies (Hedges and Olkin 1985).""
  - ""We make three assumptions: (1) the number of females that become receptive after mating is, obviously, higher in polyandrous species; (2) if females receive a small spermatophore, the number that become receptive again will be proportionally higher in polyandrous species; (3) females receiving a small spermatophore are more likely to show diminished oviposition rates because of the time and energy they devote to attracting another mate and/or because of differential allocation.""",,"- The paper provides detailed descriptions of the methods used for the meta-analysis, such as data collection, statistical analysis, and testing for differences between groups. This suggests that the authors were involved in these aspects of the study.

  - ""We synthesized studies reporting these metrics with a random-effects meta-analysis to test (i) the universality of Bateman's claim that sexual selection is typically stronger in males than in females and (ii) the evolutionary link of sexual selection with sex-biased parental care and sexual dimorphism, accounting for phylogenetic nonindependence and for repeated measurements of the same species.""
  - ""We identified 72 studies on 66 animal species, providing estimates of I, I s , and/or b ss for males and females (Fig. 1""
  - ""We performed a meta-analysis to test the generality of Bateman's principles across the animal kingdom and to explore how between-study variation in the three tested Bateman parameters translates into differences in parental care and sexual dimorphism.""
  - ""The systematic literature search largely followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement (44).""

The relative importance of size and asymmetry in sexual selection,"R Thornhid', A P M0ller, A P Moller",-,-,,88,1998,Thornhill_1998.pdf,yes,"  - ""The data set used for the present study is from Mailer and Thornhill (1998), which was based on (1) a comprehensive search of the literature and of the Internet for information on the relationship between asymmetry and sexual selection, and (2) correspondence between the authors and behavioral ecologists conducting research on this relationship.""
  - ""We were able to obtain unpublished correlation coefficients for character size for a few additional studies that were also included in this study.""
  - ""All the data are presented in Table 1""
  - ""The aim of the present study was to test whether the magnitude of the effect of asymmetry on sexual selection was similar to that of character size per se, which is known from numerous studies to be related to sexual selection (see review in Andersson, 1994).""
  - ""The test consisted of pairwise comparisons of the magnitude of a standardized effect size for asymmetry and size of the same characters in the large sample of studies composing the meta-analysis mentioned above.""
  - ""A second objective of this study was to test whether the difference in effect size for character size and symmetry differed between secondary sexual characters and ordinary morphological traits.""
  - ""We are unaware of ways of performing meta-analyses in a phylogenetic framework, although such a solution eventually may become possible.""
  - ""The general role of asymmetry in sexual selection has been disputed because several studies have shown no effects, whereas others have demonstrated highly significant effects.""
  - ""In conclusion, the relative importance of character size and symmetry was evaluated meta-anah/tically for all available studies, and the calculations demonstrated significant relationships for both size and symmetry, but symmetry appears to have a slightly greater effect, especially in studies of secondary sexual traits.""",,"- The paper provides a detailed description of the methodology and objectives of the study, indicating the authors' contributions in terms of data collection, analysis, and interpretation.
