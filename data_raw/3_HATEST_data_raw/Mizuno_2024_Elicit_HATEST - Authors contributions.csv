Body size affects the evolution of eyespots in caterpillars,"Thomas John Hossie, John Skelhorn, Jesse W Breinholt, Akito Y Kawahara, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,50,2015,Hossie_2015.pdf,no,"  - ""Our findings add to the mounting body of research suggesting that antipredator adaptations are closely linked to other aspects of prey life history and habitat use.""
  - ""Our examination of hawkmoth caterpillar traits revealed that eyespots generally are more common in species whose larvae attain relatively large body size; however, an important exception to this relationship is the frangipani hornworm (Pseudosphinx tetrio).""
  - ""Our phylogenetic analysis clearly demonstrates that the evolution of eyespots is associated with large body size, and our field and laboratory experiments provide an explanation for this; eyespots increase predation rates on small caterpillars by making them easier to detect, but-at least as far as our laboratory data and previous studies (11,12) indicate-large eyespots decrease predation rates on large caterpillars, likely because they intimidate predators""
  - ""Here we provide a thorough analysis of the phylogenetic distribution of eyespots in hawkmoth caterpillars, and a clear answer as to why eyespots are not ubiquitous in lepidopteran larvae more generally.""",,"- The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of eyespots in caterpillars, focusing on their association with body size and their effectiveness as a deterrent against predators.
- The authors conducted phylogenetic analyses, field experiments, and laboratory experiments to investigate the role of eyespots in hawkmoth caterpillars.
- The paper discusses the findings from these experiments, highlighting how eyespots affect predation rates differently for small and large caterpillars.
- The authors also discuss the broader implications of their findings, linking them to the evolution of antipredator adaptations in relation to prey life history and habitat use.
- However, there is no explicit section or statement within the paper that describes the specific roles or contributions of each author."

Eyespots interact with body colour to protect caterpillar-like prey from avian predators,"Thomas John Hossie, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,Animal Behaviour,37,2012,Hossie_2012.pdf,no,"  - ""The extent to which variation in behaviour and morphology influence predation of eyespot caterpillars by avian predators is currently being evaluated.""
  - ""Such behaviours have long been recognized in caterpillars with eyespots (Bates 1862; Poulton 1890) and also occur in Papilio sp. caterpillars (T. J. Hossie, personal observation).""
  - ""The diversity of eyespots observed in the natural world, many of which only vaguely resemble eyes, suggests that eyespots need not closely resemble a predator's eyes; however, it is conceivable that the reduced efficacy of eyespots that we observed may also have been the result of our eyespot design.""
  - ""Experiments were run between 25 May and 27 August 2010, which corresponds roughly to the dates when Canadian tiger swallowtail, Papilio canadensis, caterpillars could be found in the wild in our study area (Hall et al. 1996; T. J. Hossie, personal observation).""
  - ""The entire process was replicated nine times (three times per site, albeit at a different location within site) for a total of 864 artificial prey deployed.""",,"- The paper provides several instances where the authors mention their personal observations or involvement in the study, such as T. J. Hossie's personal observation of Papilio sp. caterpillars and the replication of the experiment process.

Significance of butterfly eyespots as an anti-predator device in ground-based and aerial attacks,"Anne Lyytinen, Paul M Brakefield, Johanna Mappes",-,-,,93,2003,Lyytinen_2003.pdf,no,"  - ""To test the deflection hypothesis, we compared the survival of the spotless dry season form and spotted wet season form of Bicyclus anynana and examined the target of initial strike.""
  - ""We used two model predators: lizards (Anolis carolinensis) and pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) that are visually hunting insectivorous predators.""
  - ""Lizards (n =16) were kept in a group of four (3 females and 1 male) in enclosures (32 × 45× 58 cm) which were placed in a room maintained at 25°C, 70% humidity, and under photoperiod 16h:8h light:dark.""
  - ""Pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) are small passerine birds that feed on insects and other arthropods catching them in the air, from foliage, or from the ground.""
  - ""The experiment was conducted in June 2001 at the Konnevesi Research Station.""
  - ""We did not find eyespots to be advantageous to butterflies when the attack came from the ground level or from above.""
  - ""In our experiments, lizards and birds preyed upon butterflies which were at rest or feeding on a banana slice, and hence the possible differences in activity levels or escape efficiency of butterfly forms did not influence the results.""",,"- The paper describes the experimental setup and methods used to test the hypothesis about the role of eyespots in butterflies as an anti-predator device.

The Feeding Behaviour of Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) in the Presence of 'Eyes',"I R Inglis, L W Huson, M B Marshall, P A Arid,  Neville",-,-,-,-,-,Inglis_1983.pdf,yes,"  - ""The present study investigates the ability of eye-like patterns to deter hungry starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) from feeding with a view to the potential use of such stimuli as bird scarers.""
  - ""The experimental procedure was designed to provide a relevant and objective, interval scale of aversiveness based upon the ability of eye patterns to deter hungry birds from a feeding area.""
  - ""The subjects were eight adult starlings randomly selected from the pool of wild caught birds.""
  - ""The apparatus and procedure were as described for Experiment 2.""
  - ""The principal component analysis showed that the first component contained the signs of the latent vectors of the variables in the same pattern as in the previous experiments.""
  - ""The construction of an absolute aversive scale would have involved the analysis of the raw data within a single principal component analysis.""
  - ""The inclusion of one stimulus in all 8 experiments made it possible to express the mean aversiveness of the stimuli within any one experiment relative to that 'standard' stimulus.""",,"- The paper describes the experimental design, procedures, and analysis methods used in the study, which suggests that the authors were involved in designing and conducting the experiments.
- The use of phrases like ""the present study investigates"" and ""the experimental procedure was designed"" implies that the authors were responsible for planning and executing the research.
- The mention of ""the subjects were eight adult starlings"" and ""the apparatus and procedure were as described"" indicates that the authors were involved in selecting subjects and setting up the experimental apparatus.
- The discussion of statistical analyses, such as principal component analysis and ANOVA, suggests that the authors were responsible for data analysis.

The position of eyespots and thickened segments influence their protective value to caterpillars,"John Skelhorn, Giles Dorrington, Thomas J Hossie, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,,16,2014,Skelhorn_2014.pdf,yes,"  - ""Fifty-nine newly hatched domestic chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus) of the ""Ross"" strain were purchased from a commercial hatchery in Berwickshire, UK. They were transported to the laboratory by car (approximately 90-min drive), where they were housed in 3 cages measuring 120 × 50 × 50 cm.""
  - ""Chicks were weighed and visually inspected by J.S. daily to ensure they remained in good health: all chicks gained weight as the experiment progressed.""
  - ""Chicks underwent 6 training trials at regular intervals: 3 on Day 2 posthatch and 3 on Day 3 posthatch.""
  - ""In all training and experimental trials, 2 chicks were placed in the buddy arena to reduce any potential distress from placing experimental chicks alone in the arena.""
  - ""Chicks were food deprived for 30 min before each of the training trials on Day 2 to ensure they were motivated to forage in the experimental arena.""
  - ""During all training trials, the 2 arenas were used simultaneously. However, during the single test trial, only 1 subject performed the experiment at any 1 time, in order to ensure that measurements were taken accurately.""
  - ""By the end of the training trials, all chicks had pecked the branch and were eating crumbs in the experimental arena.""
  - ""At the end of training, birds were split into 2 groups: 27 chicks went on to take part in Experiment 1, whereas the remaining 24 went on to take part in Experiment 2.""
  - ""Experiment 1: does the position of eyespots influence their antipredator efficacy?""
  - ""Experiment 2: does the position of thickened body segments influence their antipredator efficacy?""
  - ""Our experiments clearly demonstrate that predators are more wary of prey (i.e., they inspected them for longer and performed more approach-retreat behaviors) with eyespots and with thickened sections, but only when these traits are placed in an anterior position consistent with the position of the head in dangerous vertebrates.""",,"- The paper provides detailed descriptions of the experimental setup and procedures, which were likely conducted by the authors.
- The mention of ""J.S."" in the context of daily inspections suggests that John Skelhorn was involved in monitoring the health of the chicks.
- The structured approach to training and testing the chicks indicates a coordinated effort among the authors.
- The paper does not explicitly state the roles or contributions of each author, but it implies that they were involved in designing and conducting the experiments."
"The protective value of conspicuous signals is not impaired by shape, size, or position asymmetry","Martin Stevens, Sarah A Castor-Perry, Jessica R F Price",-,-,,19,2009,Stevens&CastorPerry_2009.pdf,no,"  - ""We undertook 2 field experiments with artificial gray-scale prey, marked with a pair of white markings presented to wild avian predators, to test the effect of asymmetry on the survival value of conspicuous signals in the field.""
  - ""Here, we undertake 2 field experiments with artificial palatable prey presented to wild avian predators, to determine the importance of several types of asymmetry on predator avoidance of conspicuous prey.""
  - ""The experiment followed the same overall procedure as Stevens et al. (2007) and Stevens, Hardman, and Stubbins (2008) , with gray-scale artificial ''prey,'' 76 mm wide and 38 mm high, made from triangular pieces of waterproof paper (HP LaserJet Tough Paper, Palo Alto, CA).""
