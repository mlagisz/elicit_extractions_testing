Can the way pigs are handled alter behavioural and physiological measures of affective state?,"Ricard Carreras, Laura Arroyo, Eva Mainau, Daniel Valent, Anna Bassols, Antoni Dalmau, Luigi Faucitano, Xavier Manteca, Antonio Velarde",-,-,Behavioural Processes,16,2017,Carreras2017.pdf,no,"  - ""At the end of the reminder sessions, each pig was individually subjected to the CBT where a bucket containing two pieces of chopped apple that were accessible by the pig was placed in the middle of the pen.""
  - ""Once animals are able to discriminate between the positive and the negative stimuli they are submitted to the test session where a stimulus intermediate between the previous two, called the ambiguous stimulus, is presented and the response of the animals is assessed.""",,"- The paper describes the cognitive bias test (CBT) as involving a stimulus intermediate between the positive and negative stimuli, which is referred to as the ambiguous stimulus.
- The description of the CBT procedure indicates that a single ambiguous stimulus is used in the test session, as it mentions a ""stimulus intermediate between the previous two"" and a ""bucket containing two pieces of chopped apple"" as the ambiguous stimulus.
- There is no mention of multiple ambiguous cues being used in the judgement bias trials. The focus is on a single ambiguous stimulus that is intermediate between the positive and negative stimuli."
"Does stocking density modify affective state in pigs as assessed by cognitive bias, behavioural and physiological parameters?","Annalisa Scollo, Flaviana Gottardo, Barbara Contiero, Sandra A Edwards",-,-,,62,2014,Scollo2014.pdf,yes,"  - ""the three ambiguous 'probe' locations were located at equidistant intermediate locations (1.5 m apart) between the two reference locations (Fig. 1""
  - ""During the testing days, the animals of the tested batch were individually exposed once per day to each of the three ambiguous probe locations (near rewarded: NR; middle: M; near unrewarded: NU), spread within a pseudorandom sequence of the two reference locations.""",,"- The paper describes the use of ""three ambiguous probe locations"" during the testing days. These locations are identified as ""near rewarded: NR; middle: M; near unrewarded: NU.""
- The mention of ""three ambiguous probe locations"" directly answers the question about the number of different ambiguous cues used in the judgement bias trials.
- The description of these locations as being ""at equidistant intermediate locations"" between the rewarded and unrewarded sites further clarifies that these are distinct cues used in the experiment."
Effect of gender and halothane genotype on cognitive bias and its relationship with fear in pigs,"Ricard Carreras, Laura Arroyo, Eva Mainau, Raquel Pe Ña, Anna Bassols, Antoni Dalmau, Luigi Faucitano, Xavier Manteca, Antonio Velarde",-,-,,17,2016,Carreras2016.pdf,no,"  - ""The novel object test (NOT) was performed in the same test pen four days after the CBT. In this test the novel object was represented by a traffic cone located in the centre of the pen.""
  - ""The overall objective of this study was to determine the CB in pigs of different gender and carrying or not carrying the Hal gene.""
  - ""The CBT and NOT results did not show any effect of the genotype and gender or their interaction on pigs' emotional response (p > 0.10).""
  - ""the CBT correlated positively with the NOT (r = 0.49; p = 0.0005), with pigs classified with a negative CB tending to be more fearful in front of the novel object than those with a positive CB (p = 0.05).""
  - ""The latency to contact the novel object during the NOT was positively correlated with the latency to contact the bucket during the CBT (r = 0.49; p = 0.0005).""",,"- The paper discusses the use of a cognitive bias test (CBT) and a novel object test (NOT) to assess emotional responses in pigs.
- The CBT is used to assess cognitive bias, which involves ambiguous stimuli.
- The NOT is used to assess fear responses, with a novel object (a traffic cone) serving as the stimulus.
- The paper does not explicitly mention the number of ambiguous cues used in the CBT.
- The focus is on the relationship between cognitive bias and fear, rather than the specifics of the number of cues.
- The paper does not provide a clear indication of the number of different ambiguous cues used in the judgement bias trials."
"Effects of Cage Enrichment on Behavior, Welfare and Outcome Variability in Female Mice","Jeremy D Bailoo, Eimear Murphy, Maria Boada-Saña, Justin A Varholick, Sara Hintze, Caroline Baussière, Kerstin C Hahn, Christine Göpfert, Rupert Palme, Bernhard Voelkl, Hanno Würbel",-,-,Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience,85,2018,Bailoo_2018.pdf,yes,"  - ""The Go: No-go response ratio to all five goal-holes (positive, three ambiguous, negative) was used as a measure of judgment bias.""
  - ""Once animals had learned this discrimination, ambiguous test trials with open goal-holes at three equidistant intermediate locations between the extreme ends, were interspersed among Go and No-Go trials, across six test sessions.""",,"- The paper describes the use of ""ambiguous test trials"" in the judgment bias task, which involved open goal-holes at ""three equidistant intermediate locations.""
- The mention of ""three ambiguous"" goal-holes in the context of the judgment bias task indicates that there were three different ambiguous cues used.
- The question specifically asks for the ""Number of ambiguous cues"" used in the judgment bias trials, which is directly answered by the information provided in the paper."
Frontal brain deactivation during a non-verbal cognitive judgement bias test in sheep,"Kathrin Guldimann, Sabine Vögeli, Martin Wolf, Beat Wechsler, Lorenz Gygax",-,-,Brain and Cognition,20,2015,Guldimann2015.pdf,yes,"  - ""The ambiguous box positions were at a relative distance of 30% (at 0.9 m), 50% (at 1.5 m) and 70% (at 2.1 m) between the positions of the positively and the negatively reinforced boxes.""
  - ""In the test phase, sheep went through one session with five trials. In addition to the negatively and positively reinforced box locations in each corner of the testing area, three ambiguous locations were presented.""",,"- The paper describes the setup of the cognitive judgement bias test, which includes three ambiguous locations in addition to the positively and negatively reinforced box locations.
- These ambiguous locations are positioned at different distances between the positive and negative cue locations, indicating they are distinct cues.
- The number of ambiguous cues is explicitly mentioned as ""three ambiguous locations,"" which are used in the judgement bias trials."
"Measurement of cognitive bias and cortisol levels to evaluate the effects of space restriction on captive collared peccary (Mammalia, Tayassuidae)","Flávia R M Oliveira, Sérgio L G Nogueira-Filho, Maria B C Sousa, Carlos T S Dias, Michael Mendl, Selene S C Nogueira",-,-,,11,2016,Oliveira2016.pdf,no,"  - ""In judgement bias tests a 3 s 'ambiguous' auditory cue -a drumstick hitting an aluminum plate, CS A (Freq average 6 kHz; 62.8 dB) was presented to the animals.""
  - ""An 'ambiguous' auditory cue (a drumstick hitting an aluminum plate; CS A ) was presented to probe decision-making under ambiguity.""",,"- The paper describes the use of a single ""ambiguous"" auditory cue in the judgement bias trials, which is a drumstick hitting an aluminum plate, referred to as CS A.
- There is no mention of multiple ambiguous cues being used; only this specific cue is described as the ambiguous cue.
- The focus is on how the animals respond to this single ambiguous cue under different housing conditions, not on multiple ambiguous cues."
The effects of housing conditions on judgement bias in Japanese quail,"Mária Horváth, Katarína Pichová, L ' Ubor Košt'ál",-,-,,12,2016,Horvàth2016.pdf,yes,"  - ""The cues were represented by shades of grey intermediate between those associated with reward and punishment in the previous discriminative learning (NP -near-positive, 20% grey; M -middle, 40% grey; NN -near-negative, 60% grey and reverse order for the half of animals in Exp3 and Exp4)""
  - ""In the judgement bias tests in addition to the two cues used in discrimination training (P and N), hens were exposed to the three cues, with no consequences provided for responding on these.""",,"- The paper describes the use of three ambiguous cues in the judgement bias tests, which are intermediate shades of grey between the positive and negative cues.
- These cues are specifically identified as NP (near-positive), M (middle), and NN (near-negative), indicating that there are three distinct ambiguous cues used in the trials."
Validation of a novel cognitive bias task based on difference in quantity of reinforcement for assessing environmental enrichment,"Heidi A Keen, O Lynne Nelson, Charles T Robbins, Marc Evans, David J Shepherdson, Ruth C Newberry",-,-,-,-,-,Keen2014.pdf,yes,"  - ""Five, 20.3 cm 9 20.3 cm paper squares were shaded at 20, 35, 50, 65, and 80 % gray, respectively, using a basic word-processing program.""
  - ""The 20 and 80 % gray cues were the rewarded cues, and the three intermediate cues were the probe stimuli.""
  - ""Responses to ambiguous probe stimuli (i.e., shades of gray) intermediate to the trained stimuli were classified as either 'optimistic,' appropriate for the larger reward, or 'pessimistic,' appropriate for the smaller reward.""",,"- The paper describes the use of ""ambiguous probe stimuli"" which are shades of gray intermediate to the trained stimuli. These are used to assess cognitive bias.
- The specific shades of gray used are detailed: 20%, 35%, 50%, 65%, and 80%. However, the 20% and 80% shades are the rewarded cues, not the ambiguous ones.
- The ambiguous cues are the intermediate shades: 35%, 50%, and 65%. These are the ones used in the judgment bias trials to assess cognitive bias.
- Therefore, the number of ambiguous cues used in the judgment bias trials is 3."
