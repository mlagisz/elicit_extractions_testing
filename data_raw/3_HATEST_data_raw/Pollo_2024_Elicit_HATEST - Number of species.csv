  - ""In 22 of 25 lepidopteran species, the reproductive output of females mated to virgin males was higher than that of females mated to experienced males.""",,"- The paper explicitly states that the meta-analysis was conducted using data from 29 studies of 25 species. This is the primary source of information for determining the number of species involved in the meta-analysis.
- The mention of ""25 Lepidopteran species"" in the context of compiling data for the meta-analysis confirms that these are the species used in the analysis.
- The paper does not mention any other species beyond these 25, indicating that these are the species included in the meta-analysis."
Assortative Mating in Animals,"Yuexin Jiang, Daniel I Bolnick, Mark Kirkpatrick",-,-,American Naturalist,367,2013,Jiang_2013.pdf,254,"  - ""Our database contains 1,116 measurements of the strength of assortative mating from 254 species in five phyla""

- This number is consistently mentioned in different parts of the paper, reinforcing its accuracy.
- The tables at the end of the paper provide further details about the distribution of these species across different taxonomic groups and trait categories, but the total number of species remains consistent."
Darwinian sex roles confirmed across the animal kingdom,"Tim Janicke, Ines K Häderer, Marc J Lajeunesse, Nils Anthes",-,-,Science Advances,328,2016,Janicke_2016.pdf,66,"  - ""We identified 72 studies on 66 animal species, providing estimates of I, I s , and/or b ss for males and females (Fig. 1""
  - ""We retained a sample of n = 72 studies, covering 66 species and providing 81, 88, and 76 estimates (hereafter K) for male and female I, I s , and b ss , respectively (table S1""",,"- The paper explicitly states that the meta-analysis was conducted on data from ""66 animal species.""
- The mention of ""72 studies"" refers to the number of studies analyzed, not the number of species.
- The focus is on the number of species used in the meta-analysis, which is clearly stated as 66."
Measuring and interpreting sexual selection metrics: evaluation and guidelines,"Nils Anthes, Ines K H € Aderer, Nico K Michiels, Tim Janicke",-,-,,42,2017,Anthes_2017.pdf,48,"  - ""Within our meta-analysis data set (Janicke et al. 2016), species with average individual offspring numbers <3 make up one quarter of all studies (12 out of 48 studies for which data on the original distribution of RS was available), indicating that this problem is potentially widespread.""
  - ""Data underlying the analyses in this manuscript are deposited in the Dryad repository for Figures 2 and 4 (http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad. rs69k) (Anthes et al. 2016) and all other Figures (http://datadryad.org/resource/ doi:10.5061/dryad.780d6) (Janicke et al. 2016).""
  - ""Using our meta-analysis data set (Janicke et al. 2016), we tested for systematic changes in the opportunity for sexual selection (I s ) and the Bateman gradient (b ss ) arising from the use of genetic mating success (gMS) instead of copulatory mating success (cMS).""
  - ""while compiling a meta-analysis on sex differences in sexual selection (Janicke et al. 2016), we realized that the existing empirical work varies remarkably in key aspects of study design and analysis.""",,"- The paper mentions a meta-analysis conducted by Janicke et al. (2016), which is referenced multiple times throughout the text. This suggests that the paper is based on a meta-analysis that likely includes data from multiple species.
- The mention of ""12 out of 48 studies"" indicates that the meta-analysis includes data from at least 48 different studies, which likely involve multiple species.
- The paper does not specify the exact number of species included in the meta-analysis, but it implies that the analysis is not focused on a single species."
Mechanisms of Social Influence: A Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Social Information on Female Mate Choice Decisions,"Blake Carlton Jones, Emily H Duval",-,-,Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution,35,2019,Jones_2019.pdf,17,"  - ""Our analysis included experiments on 17 species from 13 different families, representing three classes of arthropods and two classes of vertebrates.""
  - ""The phylogenetic signal of the strength of mate-choice copying was virtually non-existent, indicating that this behavior is taxonomically widespread. Likewise, mate-choice copying was not consistent in several closely related species, e.g., there is strong support for the occurrence of mate-choice copying in Drosophila melanogaster (Germain et al., 2016;Danchin et al., 2018;Nöbel et al., 2018), but tests in Drosophila serrata found no copying (Auld et al., 2009). However, studies that met our criteria of providing individual-level counts of mating choices represented only 17 total species.""
  - ""The reported differences between levels of the explanatory factors are likely underestimated, specifically for male attractiveness and observer experience, as one of the two compared levels for each factor included unavoidable uncertainty. For example, for classification of observer experience, there was no ambiguity when studies used virgin female observers, but when observers were drawn from a population of unknown age or experience (e.g., wild studies, mixed-sex tanks), the testing group almost certainly included a mix of individuals, some of which might have been virgins or females with relatively low sexual experience.""",,"- The paper explicitly states that the meta-analysis included experiments on ""17 species from 13 different families.""
- This number is consistently mentioned throughout the paper, indicating that these 17 species were the ones used in the meta-analysis.
- The mention of ""17 total species"" in multiple contexts confirms that this is the number of species used in the meta-analysis."
No evidence of immediate fitness benefits of within-season divorce in monogamous birds,"Antica Culina, Lyanne Brouwer",-,-,Biology Letters,5,2022,Culina_2022.pdf,24,"  - ""Here, we meta-analysed 90 effect sizes on within-season divorce and breeding success, extracted from 31 studies on 24 species.""
  - ""Our full dataset included 31 relevant studies on 24 socially monogamous bird species (table 1 for summary, and data tables), belonging to six bird orders (15 to Passerifomes; five to Charadriiformes, one each to Falconifomes, Piciformes, Strigifomes and Suliformes).""","  - ""(Page 3, Table 1) | analysis | *N* of effect sizes | *N* of species | *N* of studies | references     |\n|----------|---------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n| before   | 27                  | 10             | 13             | [26–38]        |""","- The paper explicitly states that the meta-analysis was conducted on ""31 studies on 24 species,"" which directly answers the question about the number of species used in the meta-analysis.
- The mention of ""24 socially monogamous bird species"" further confirms that the meta-analysis involved data from 24 different species.
- The table referenced at the end of the paper likely provides additional details about the studies and species included in the meta-analysis, but the text itself clearly states the number of species involved."
The relative importance of size and asymmetry in sexual selection,"R Thornhid', A P M0ller, A P Moller",-,-,,88,1998,Thornhill_1998.pdf,29,"  - ""The sample size for studies (n •= 33) and species (n = 29) were moderate.""
  - ""Studies that allowed comparison of the relationships for the same traits' size and symmetry and success in sexual competition constituted the data, which totaled 73 samples from 33 studies of 29 species.""
  - ""The data set used for the present study is from Mailer and Thornhill (1998), which was based on (1) a comprehensive search of the literature and of the Internet for information on the relationship between asymmetry and sexual selection, and (2) correspondence between the authors and behavioral ecologists conducting research on this relationship.""
  - ""Analysis was conducted on samples, studies, and species separately.""",,"- The paper explicitly states that the meta-analysis was conducted using data from ""33 studies of 29 species."" This indicates that the number of species used in the meta-analysis is 29.
- The mention of ""73 samples from 33 studies of 29 species"" further confirms that the analysis involved data from 29 different species.
- The paper does not focus on a single species but rather conducts a meta-analysis across multiple species, which supports the conclusion that the number of species is 29."
Variation in pre-and post-copulatory sexual selection on male genital size in two species of lygaeid bug,"Liam R Dougherty, David M Shuker",-,-,Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology,18,2016,Dougherty_2016.pdf,1,"  - ""Analyses were performed separately for the linear and quadratic selection gradients. The variance associated with each effect size was calculated as SE 2 . For both datasets, the mean effect size was estimated using a random-effects meta-analysis.""
  - ""The variancestandardised linear or quadratic selection gradient was used as the effect size. This was first calculated using the data collected in this study following the method of Morrissey and Sakrejda (2013). Five pairs (linear and quadratic) of effect size estimates were obtained: one from this experiment, two derived from previous published studies (Tadler 1999;Tadler et al. 1999) and two re-calculated using data from a recently published experiment (Dougherty et al. 2015)""
  - ""The strength of post-copulatory sexual selection on processus length in L. simulans across these different studies was estimated using formal meta-analysis.""
  - ""We assessed how the strength and pattern of selection on processus length varied between different stages of mating (before or after mating), social contexts (the number of males and females present during mating trials) and studies.""
  - ""We measured the strength and pattern of selection acting on the length of the male intromittent organ (or processus) in two closely related species of lygaeid seed bug: Lygaeus equestris and Lygaeus simulans.""",,"- The paper focuses on two species, Lygaeus equestris and Lygaeus simulans, as indicated by the first quote.
- The meta-analysis is specifically mentioned in relation to Lygaeus simulans, as indicated by the third and fourth quotes.
- The meta-analysis combines data from multiple studies, but it is focused on a single species, Lygaeus simulans, as indicated by the fourth quote.
- The paper does not mention any other species being included in the meta-analysis or meta-regression."
