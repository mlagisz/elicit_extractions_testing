Can skyglow reduce nocturnal melatonin concentrations in Eurasian perch? *,"Franziska Kupprat, Franz H € Olker, Werner Kloas, Sarah Harmon",-,-,Environmental Pollution,39,2020,Kupprat_2020.pdf,yes,"  - ""As shown in the supplementary material of an earlier publication using the same setup, melatonin in the tank water was relatively stable under experimental daylight conditions of up to 7000 lx over 7.5 h and therefore differences in melatonin most likely derive from production and subsequent secretion of melatonin rather than photodegradation (Brüning et al., 2015).""

  - ""The complete LMM specifications and post-hoc results can be obtained from the supplementary material.""",,"- The paper mentions that additional details such as the complete LMM specifications and post-hoc results are available in the supplementary material.

LIGHT AT NIGHT CANNOT SUPPRESS PINEAL MELATONIN LEVELS IN THE LIZARD ANOLZS CAROLZNENSZS,Herbert Underwcod,-,-,-,-,-,Underwood_1986.pdf,no,"  - ""The present study was undertaken to discriminate between these two possibilities by observing the effects of high intensity (natural and artificial) light pulses on night time pineal melatonin levels in Anolis.""
  - ""All lizards were killed at 3 p.m. and the pineals were removed, placed in chilled PBS buffer, stored at -20°C and subsequently assayed for melatonin via RIA as described previously (Underwood et al., 1984).""
  - ""The dark controls were killed within seconds of exposure to light (room illumination).""
  - ""Groups of sun-exposed and dark control anoles were killed at 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. and melatonin levels were subsequently assayed.""
  - ""The response of the Anolis pineal to acute night interruption is in contrast to that observed in birds and mammals.""
  - ""The pineal melatonin rhythm in Anolis can be entrained by either 24 hr light or temperature cycles (Underwood, 1985).""
  - ""The pineal organ of chicks can also exhibit a melatonin rhythm in vitro and, in addition, a light-entrainable melatonin rhythm can be observed in a dispersed chick pineal cell culture (Takahashi et al., 1981; Deguchi, 1979).""
  - ""Fragments of chick pineal organs containing less than 1% of the whole gland are rhythmic (Takahashi and Menaker, 1984).""
  - ""If, as seems likely, the Anolis pineal is also comprised of multiple circadian oscillators (individual cells?), the mutual phaserelationships among these oscillators will determine the duration and amplitude of the output of these oscillators (i.e. melatonin).""",,"- The paper provides detailed descriptions of the methods used in the study, such as the exposure of lizards to light and the measurement of melatonin levels.
- There are references to previous studies and methods, such as the use of RIA for melatonin assays, which suggests that detailed methods are available in other publications.
- The paper discusses various aspects of the study, including the effects of light on melatonin levels and the entrainment of circadian oscillators, but it does not mention any supplementary materials or additional files.
- The absence of any mention of supplementary materials or online links suggests that the paper does not include or reference any supplementary materials."

  - ""Confirmation that the rhythm is truly circadian would require documentation of a daily changing pattern of melatonin in DD with a period of approximately 24 h.""
  - ""The present study suggests that the blood plasma melatonin rhythm of T. rugosa is a circadian rhythm because it persists in a constant photothermal environment.""",,"- The paper discusses the persistence of a plasma melatonin rhythm in constant darkness and its inhibition by constant light in the sleepy lizard, Tiliqua rugosa.
