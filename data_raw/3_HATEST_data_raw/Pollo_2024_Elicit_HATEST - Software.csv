  - ""We converted these correlations to Hedges' d using the MetaWin 2.0 calculator (Rosenberg et al. 2000) and setting the sample sizes for the two groups as half the total sample size (Table 2""
  - ""We report the mean effect size and 95% confidence intervals calculated using a bias-corrected bootstrap approach (1,000 replicates), as well as the within-group heterogeneity (Q w ) for each group of studies, assuming Q w follows a chi-square distribution, with df=number of studies1.""
  - ""We ran random effects models that allow for a true random component, in addition to sampling error, as a source of variation in effect size among studies (Hedges and Olkin 1985).""",,"- The paper mentions the use of ""MetaWin 2.0"" for converting correlations to Hedges' d and for calculating mean effect sizes. This indicates that MetaWin 2.0 is a software package used for statistical analysis in the study.
- The mention of ""random effects models"" and ""bias-corrected bootstrap approach"" suggests that these statistical methods were likely implemented using MetaWin 2.0, as it is a software designed for meta-analysis.
- The use of ""randomisation tests"" further supports the role of MetaWin 2.0 in the analysis, as it is capable of performing such tests."

  - ""Mobley & Jones (2013) offer a maximum likelihood procedure to estimate mating system variables in open and incompletely sampled populations. The procedure has recently been implemented in a user-friendly interface called Batemanater, and provides estimates and bootstrap-based confidence intervals for I, I s and b ss (Jones 2015).""
  - ""Using our meta-analysis data set (Janicke et al. 2016), we tested for systematic changes in the opportunity for sexual selection (I s ) and the Bateman gradient (b ss ) arising from the use of genetic mating success (gMS) instead of copulatory mating success (cMS).""",,"- The paper mentions the use of a ""meta-analysis data set"" which suggests that some form of statistical software or package was used for analysis, but it does not specify the software.
- The mention of ""Batemanater"" indicates that this is a software or tool used for estimating mating system variables, but it is not clear if it is a standalone software or a package within another software.
- The data deposition in Dryad repositories suggests that data management and sharing tools were used, but again, this does not specify the software used for analysis.
- There is no explicit mention of any specific software or software packages used for analysis in the paper."

The relative importance of size and asymmetry in sexual selection,"R Thornhid', A P M0ller, A P Moller",-,-,,88,1998,Thornhill_1998.pdf,NA (unclear),"  - ""Meta-analysis consists of obtaining an estimate of the magnitude of a general effect of interest from each of a number of studies, calculating average effects, and elucidating moderator variables that account for heterogeneity among studies.""
  - ""We calculated effect sizes as the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients, following the procedures outlined in Rosenthal (1991), Hedges and Olkin (1985), and Cooper and Hedges (1994).""
  - ""Weighted mean effect sizes were calculated using Fisher's transformation of r to Z, (Sokal and Rohlf, 1996) and calculation of a mean weighted Zn where mean weighted Z, a 1 uyZySwŵ here u>j is the weight factor for analysis unit j, with Wj equaling Nj-3 in the present case (Rosenthal, 1991).""
  - ""The Z\was converted to ? and the significance level of whether r differed significantly from zero was subsequently determined, following Hedges and Olkin (1985), using mean weighted utj = (Nj -S)fl(N -3), where Nia the sum of the sample sizes in the analysis, and Nj -3 is summed over all j from 1 to A, which is the number of analysis units (e.g., * = 29 for spedes analysis).""
  - ""Confidence intervals on these r values were calculated using a modification of Hedges and Olkin (1985).""
  - ""Although the effects of symmetry and size in relation to sexual selection were based on the same individuals and thus were dependent, the overall correlation between the two effects was near zero (see Results).""
  - ""we calculated a confidence interval on the difference between symmetry and size mean weighted Rvalues as the difference in Z,± 1.96/(N -3k), where 1.96 was the two-tailed critical value of the standard normal distribution; N and k are as described above.""",,"- The paper discusses the use of meta-analysis techniques, which typically involve statistical software or packages to perform calculations such as Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients and Fisher's transformation.
- The references to Rosenthal (1991), Hedges and Olkin (1985), and Cooper and Hedges (1994) suggest that these authors' methods and possibly software or packages were used for meta-analysis.
- The mention of Fisher's transformation and the calculation of weighted mean effect sizes indicates the use of statistical software or packages that can perform these functions.
- The paper does not explicitly mention any specific software or software packages by name, but it implies the use of statistical software for meta-analysis."
Variation in pre-and post-copulatory sexual selection on male genital size in two species of lygaeid bug,"Liam R Dougherty, David M Shuker",-,-,Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology,18,2016,Dougherty_2016.pdf,"R version 3.1.0, Metafor package","  - ""All statistical analyses were performed in R version 3.1.0 (R Development Core Team 2014).""
  - ""Analyses were performed separately for the linear and quadratic selection gradients. The variance associated with each effect size was calculated as SE 2 . For both datasets, the mean effect size was estimated using a random-effects meta-analysis. The mean effect size estimate was considered to be significantly different from zero if the 95 % confidence intervals did not include zero. The I 2 statistic was used to determine the amount of heterogeneity in effect sizes across studies; this gives the percentage of variation in effect sizes due to heterogeneity rather than by chance (Higgins et al. 2003). Finally, a mixedeffects meta-analytic model (random-effects model with a categorical fixed factor: Nakagawa and Santos 2012) was used to test if the mean effect size for each type of selection differed due to study author, and a meta-regression model was used to test if effect size was significantly affected by study year. This analysis was performed in R 3.0.1 (R Development Core Team 2014) using the Metafor package (Viechtbauer 2010).""",,"- The paper explicitly mentions that all statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.1.0, indicating that R is the primary software used for analysis.
- Additionally, the paper specifies that the Metafor package was used within R for meta-analysis, which is a software package used for meta-analysis in R.
- The mention of R version 3.0.1 and the use of the Metafor package further confirms the use of these software tools in the analysis."
