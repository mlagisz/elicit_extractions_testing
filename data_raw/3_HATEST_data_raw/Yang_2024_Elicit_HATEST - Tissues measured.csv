  - ""Melatonin concentrations were determined in duplicates according to manufacturer's protocol with a commercially available ELISA kit (Melatonin Saliva ELISA, IBL, Hamburg, Germany).""",,"- The paper explicitly states that melatonin was measured from the tank water, indicating that the tissue measured was not directly from the fish but rather from the water in which they were kept.
- The method of measurement involved noninvasive sampling of tank water, which aligns with the use of water as the medium for melatonin measurement.
- The mention of melatonin being released into the water via the gills supports the idea that water was used as a proxy for measuring melatonin levels.
- The normalization of melatonin concentrations to tank water and fish biomass further confirms that water was the primary medium for measurement."
"Differential response of diurnal and nocturnal mammals to prolonged altered light-dark cycle: a possible role of mood associated endocrine, inflammatory and antioxidant system","Ruchika Kumari, Vivek Verma, Noga Kronfeld-Schor, Muniyandi Singaravel",-,-,Chronobiology International,12,2021,Kumari_2021.pdf,blood,"  - ""After 4 weeks, animals were subjected to sucrose preference test and blood and brain tissues were collected for measuring melatonin, corticosterone, proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and the activity of primary antioxidant enzymes, catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD).""
  - ""Immediately after the blood collection, animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, decapitated and brains were removed (n = 5/group). The hippocampus was immediately isolated at 4°C and 10% homogenate was prepared in ice-cold 100 mM phosphate buffer saline (pH-7.4).""
  - ""Samples were subjected to ELISA, and the activity of antioxidant enzymes was measured.""
  - ""ELISA was performed to measure melatonin (Elabscience, USA, catalog no. E-ELM0788) and corticosterone (Gbiosciences, USA, catalog no. IT5614) levels in serum and to measure TNF-α (Elabscience, USA Catalog No. E-EL-M0049) in serum and hippocampus following manufacturer's instruction""",,"- The paper mentions that ""blood and brain tissues were collected for measuring melatonin,"" which indicates that melatonin levels were measured in blood.
- The ELISA was performed to measure melatonin levels in serum, which is a component of blood.
- The paper does not mention any other tissues such as pineal, SCN, urinary, retina, or water being used for melatonin measurement.
- The focus on serum for melatonin measurement is consistent throughout the paper."
LIGHT AT NIGHT CANNOT SUPPRESS PINEAL MELATONIN LEVELS IN THE LIZARD ANOLZS CAROLZNENSZS,Herbert Underwcod,-,-,-,-,-,Underwood_1986.pdf,pineal,"  - ""All lizards were killed at 3 p.m. and the pineals were removed, placed in chilled PBS buffer, stored at -20°C and subsequently assayed for melatonin via RIA as described previously (Underwood et al., 1984).""

  - ""Groups of sun-exposed and dark control anoles were killed at 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. and melatonin levels were subsequently assayed.""",,"- The paper explicitly states that the pineals were removed from the lizards and used for melatonin assays. This indicates that the tissue measured for melatonin levels was the pineal.
- The repeated mention of pineal removal and subsequent melatonin assay confirms that the pineal was the primary tissue used for measurement.
