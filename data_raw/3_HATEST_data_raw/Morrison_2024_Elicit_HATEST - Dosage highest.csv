  - ""Developmental CPF exposure has been shown to significantly alter locomotor activity [17,25,26] and impair cognitive functioning in both adolescent and adult rats [2,17,25,26].""",,"- The paper mentions a specific dose of chlorpyrifos (CPF) used in the experiments, which is ""0.29 μM dose (100 ng/ml)"".
- This dose is highlighted as the benchmark dose used because it previously showed significant effects on memory function without causing overt toxicity.
- The paper does not mention any higher doses of CPF being used in the experiments measuring behavioral effects.
- The focus on this specific dose suggests it is the highest dose used in the study for behavioral assessments."
