Artificial light at night affects brain plasticity and melatonin in birds,"Stan Moaraf, Yulia Vistoropsky, Tatyana Pozner, Rachel Heiblum, Monika Okuliarová, Michal Zeman, Anat Barnea",-,-,Neuroscience Letters,49,2019,Moaraf_2019.pdf,female,"  - ""Adult female zebra finches were reared outdoor at the Meier Segals Garden for Zoological Research at Tel-Aviv University, Israel.""
  - ""To avoid the possibility that ALAN affects singing behavior (that occurs only in males), which in turn might affect proliferation, in this study we chose to focus on females, and kept the social, behavioral, and spatial environment constant.""",,"- The paper explicitly states that the study focused on female zebra finches to avoid the potential impact of ALAN on singing behavior, which is specific to males.
- The mention of ""adult female zebra finches"" further confirms that the study was conducted using female animals."
Bright light at night alters the perception of daylength in Indian weaver bird (Ploceus philippinus),"Jayant Kumar, Shalie Malik, Sanjay Kumar Bhardwaj, Sangeeta Rani",-,-,Journal of Experimental Zoology Part A Ecological and Integrative Physiology,17,2018,Kumar_2018.pdf,male,"  - ""Adult male weaver birds were captured from nature and acclimatized in an outdoor aviary (size = 3 × 2.5 × 2.5 m) under natural photoperiod until beginning of the experiment.""

It is a photoperiodic, long day breeding sparrow-sized finch that belongs to the family Ploceidae.""",,"- The study was conducted on Indian weaver birds, specifically focusing on their response to bright light at night.
- The paper explicitly states that ""Adult male weaver birds were captured from nature and acclimatized in an outdoor aviary,"" indicating that the subjects of the study were male birds.

Can skyglow reduce nocturnal melatonin concentrations in Eurasian perch? *,"Franziska Kupprat, Franz H € Olker, Werner Kloas, Sarah Harmon",-,-,Environmental Pollution,39,2020,Kupprat_2020.pdf,unclear,"  - ""The experiment was done according to the setup and procedure of Brüning et al. (2015).""
  - ""Juvenile Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) were obtained from Lake Müggelsee (Berlin, Germany) and kept in indoor tanks (ca. 600 L) with natural photoperiod and dark nights for at least two weeks prior to moving into the aquaria of the experimental setup.""
  - ""The entire experiment was repeated once with a new set of fish directly after the first run to achieve a sufficient amount of replicates for each treatment (n ¼ 6).""
  - ""Individual fish mass was 16.83 ± 4.08 g with a standard length of 10.6 ± 0.9 cm and a total length of 12.3 ± 1.0 cm (mean ± standard deviation (SD), n ¼ 720).""
  - ""Thirty fish were moved to each aquarium and allowed to acclimate for two weeks with bright days (around 2900 lx) and dark nights, i.e. non-detectable light intensities below 0.00167 lx with the used luxmeter (ILT1700, International Light Technologies, Peabody, MA, USA).""",,"- The paper discusses an experiment involving Eurasian perch, but it does not specify the sex of the fish used in the study.
- The focus of the study is on the effects of artificial light at night (ALAN) on melatonin production in the fish, not on sex-specific differences.
- The paper provides details about the size and number of fish used in the experiment but does not mention their sex.
- The experimental setup and procedures are described, but again, there is no mention of the sex of the fish."

  - ""Freshly collected anoles were placed under stockroom conditions on 26 June 1985.""",,"- The paper discusses experiments conducted on ""anoles,"" which are a type of lizard.
- The text does not specify the sex of the lizards used in the experiments.
- The focus of the paper is on the effects of light on pineal melatonin levels, not on the sex of the animals.
- Since the paper does not provide any information about the sex of the lizards, it is unclear whether the experiments involved male, female, or mixed-sex groups."
