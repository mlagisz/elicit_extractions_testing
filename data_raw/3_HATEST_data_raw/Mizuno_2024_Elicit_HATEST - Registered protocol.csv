Body size affects the evolution of eyespots in caterpillars,"Thomas John Hossie, John Skelhorn, Jesse W Breinholt, Akito Y Kawahara, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,50,2015,Hossie_2015.pdf,no,"  - ""To examine the relationship between the possession of eyespots and body size in extant species, a phylogenetically controlled analysis is essential to conservatively control for any lack of independence of species data arising through shared ancestry (27,28).""
  - ""Here we conducted (i) the first phylogenetically controlled assessment of the association between larval body size (final instars) and the possession of eyespots in caterpillars; (ii) a field experiment using caterpillar models of different sizes exposed to wild bird predation that directly tested whether the protective value of eyespots is greater in large caterpillars compared with small caterpillars when eyespot size is proportional to body size; and (iii) a laboratory experiment in which similar caterpillar models with and without eyespots were presented to naïve domestic chicks, with body size and eyespot size manipulated independently to quantify which of these factors influences prey detection and predator hesitation.""
  - ""Through this combination of phylogenetic, field, and laboratory approaches, we comprehensively investigated whether the evolution of eyespots in caterpillars is size-dependent, and evaluated hypotheses as to why this might be so.""
  - ""We conducted phylogenetic analyses of hawkmoths in Macroglossinae, the primary subfamily, with extraordinary caterpillar eyespot morphology (20,29), and the most speciose, with more than 800 described species (30).""
  - ""The data matrix has a significantly expanded taxon set from a previously published study (31) (Dataset S1).""
  - ""We conducted a PGLS analysis on the ML tree with body size as the response variable and the presence/absence of eyespots as a binary predictor (factors are not permitted as response variables in PGLS).""
  - ""We analyzed the ""survival"" of artificial prey in the field using Cox proportional hazards regression (59), which can handle both censored data and nonuniform changes in predation risk.""
  - ""Latency to attack, search time, and inspection time in the chick experiment were each analyzed using separate factorial ANOVAs in R (60), with body size, eyespots, and body size × eyespot interaction as factors.""",,"- The paper describes a comprehensive study involving phylogenetic analysis, field experiments, and laboratory experiments. This suggests a structured approach to the research.
- The study involves multiple components, including phylogenetic analysis, field experiments, and laboratory experiments, which are typically part of a pre-defined protocol or study plan.
- The use of specific statistical methods and experimental designs indicates a structured approach, which is often part of a registered or pre-registered protocol.
- However, there is no explicit mention of the study being registered or pre-registered in the provided text."
Deflective effect and the effect of prey detectability on anti-predator function of eyespots,"Adrian Vallin, Marina Dimitrova, Ullasa Kodandaramaiah, Sami Merilaita, D Kemp",-,-,Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology,38,2011,Vallin_2011.pdf,no,"  - ""The birds were ringed and released at the site of their capture after use in the present study.""
  - ""The experimental protocol and housing of birds was reviewed and approved by the regional ethical committee in Linköping (Dnr: 62-08).""",,"- The paper mentions that the experimental protocol was reviewed and approved by an ethical committee, which suggests that there was some form of protocol or study plan in place before the study was conducted.
- However, there is no explicit mention of whether the study was registered or pre-registered. The approval by an ethical committee does not necessarily imply registration or pre-registration.
- The paper does not provide any information about a registered protocol or pre-registration, which are specific terms related to the formal registration of a study before it begins."
Eyespots interact with body colour to protect caterpillar-like prey from avian predators,"Thomas John Hossie, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,Animal Behaviour,37,2012,Hossie_2012.pdf,yes,"  - ""Pastry caterpillars were designed to be fully palatable to birds, and our experimental design was approved by the Carleton University Research Ethics Committee (Protocol B10-14).""",,"- The paper mentions that the experimental design was approved by the Carleton University Research Ethics Committee, which indicates that there was a protocol in place for the study.
- The mention of ""Protocol B10-14"" suggests that the study was registered or had a pre-defined protocol, as it is common for ethics committees to assign protocol numbers to approved studies.
- The approval by an ethics committee implies that the study was reviewed and approved before it was conducted, which aligns with the concept of a registered protocol."
Field experiments on the effectiveness of 'eyespots' as predator deterrents,"Martin Stevens, Elinor Hopkins, William Hinde, Amabel Adcock, Yvonne Connolly, Tom Troscianko, Innes C Cuthill, K T Troscianko",-,-,-,-,-,Stevens_2007.pdf,yes,"  - ""The protocol of each experiment was similar to that of Cuthill et al. (2005).""
  - ""All experiments consisted of a randomized block design, with a sample of replicates of each treatment pinned out over a series of blocks.""
  - ""Our field experiments used artificial 'moth' targets (as in Cuthill et al. 2005) with specific patterns, to test the effect on the rate of predation of different types of luminance (brightness) contrast patterns.""
  - ""The general methodology for calibrating the grey-scale targets was similar to Stevens et al. (2006)""",,"- The paper mentions that the protocol for each experiment was similar to that of Cuthill et al. (2005), indicating a pre-defined methodology was followed.
- The use of a ""randomized block design"" suggests a structured approach to the experiments, which is typical of a pre-defined protocol.
- The mention of ""the general methodology for calibrating the grey-scale targets"" being similar to Stevens et al. (2006) further supports the idea that a pre-defined protocol was used.
- The paper does not explicitly mention whether the study was registered or pre-registered, but it does imply that a pre-defined protocol was followed based on previous studies."
Significance of butterfly eyespots as an anti-predator device in ground-based and aerial attacks,"Anne Lyytinen, Paul M Brakefield, Johanna Mappes",-,-,,93,2003,Lyytinen_2003.pdf,no,"  - ""To test the deflection hypothesis, we compared the survival of the spotless dry season form and spotted wet season form of Bicyclus anynana and examined the target of initial strike.""
  - ""We used two model predators: lizards (Anolis carolinensis) and pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) that are visually hunting insectivorous predators.""
  - ""The live butterflies were presented to them whilst feeding on a piece of banana slice such that any possible differences in the behaviour between butterfly forms could not influence the result.""
  - ""To test whether eyespots affect the escape probability of butterflies after the attack, three forms (spotless, spotted, Bigeye-comet) of B. anynana differing in eyespot pattern, were placed one at a time on the slice of banana into the cages in the presence of a lizard.""
  - ""To test whether eyespots act as decoys for an avian attack, butterflies were also introduced to pied flycatchers.""
  - ""The experiment was conducted in June 2001 at the Konnevesi Research Station.""
  - ""The experiment was video recorded to analyse the target of the attack.""
  - ""In our experiments, lizards and birds preyed upon butterflies which were at rest or feeding on a banana slice, and hence the possible differences in activity levels or escape efficiency of butterfly forms did not influence the results.""",,"- The paper describes a detailed experimental setup involving the use of model predators (lizards and birds) to test the hypothesis that eyespots on butterflies serve as an anti-predator device.
- The experiments were conducted in controlled environments (cages for lizards and an aviary for birds) with specific conditions (e.g., feeding on banana slices) to minimize variables.
- The study involved video recording to analyze the target of attacks, indicating a structured protocol for data collection.
- The paper does not mention any registration or pre-registration of the study protocol, nor does it refer to a pre-defined protocol or study plan beyond the experimental design described."
The Feeding Behaviour of Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) in the Presence of 'Eyes',"I R Inglis, L W Huson, M B Marshall, P A Arid,  Neville",-,-,-,-,-,Inglis_1983.pdf,no,"  - ""The construction of an absolute aversive scale would have involved the analysis of the raw data within a single principal component analysis.""
  - ""The experimental procedure was designed to provide a relevant and objective, interval scale of aversiveness based upon the ability of eye patterns to deter hungry birds from a feeding area.""",,"- The paper describes a detailed experimental procedure and design, indicating a structured approach to the study.
- The mention of a ""relevant and objective, interval scale of aversiveness"" suggests a pre-defined protocol for measuring aversiveness.
- The experimental design and the use of principal component analysis imply a systematic approach, which is typical of a pre-defined protocol.
- However, there is no explicit mention of the study being registered or pre-registered, nor is there any reference to a specific protocol or study plan being followed."
The position of eyespots and thickened segments influence their protective value to caterpillars,"John Skelhorn, Giles Dorrington, Thomas J Hossie, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,,16,2014,Skelhorn_2014.pdf,no,"  - ""In the first experiment, chicks were presented with model caterpillars either without eyespots or with eyespots positioned in 1 of 2 locations on their bodies: anteriorly or centrally.""
  - ""In the second experiment, chicks were presented with model caterpillars either lacking the thickening associated with the defensive posture, or with models in which a thickened section was placed centrally or anteriorly.""
  - ""We reason that if eye/snake mimicry rather than novelty/conspicuousness alone is responsible for the deterrent effect of both eyespots and defensive postures, then we should only see a benefit of these traits when they are present and positioned in a way that resembles a snake.""
  - ""To differentiate between these contrasting explanations, we evaluated the responses of naive chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus) to artificial caterpillar-like prey.""
  - ""Our experiments clearly demonstrate that predators are more wary of prey (i.e., they inspected them for longer and performed more approach-retreat behaviors) with eyespots and with thickened sections, but only when these traits are placed in an anterior position consistent with the position of the head in dangerous vertebrates.""",,"- The paper describes two experiments conducted to test the hypotheses regarding the protective value of eyespots and thickened segments in caterpillars.
- The experiments were designed to differentiate between two contrasting explanations for the protective value of these traits.
- The study involved naive domestic chicks and artificial caterpillar-like prey, with specific manipulations of eyespots and thickened segments.
- The paper does not mention any registration or pre-registration of the protocol or study plan.
- The study appears to be based on a pre-defined protocol or study plan, as indicated by the structured design and hypotheses testing."
"The protective value of conspicuous signals is not impaired by shape, size, or position asymmetry","Martin Stevens, Sarah A Castor-Perry, Jessica R F Price",-,-,,19,2009,Stevens&CastorPerry_2009.pdf,yes,"  - ""We undertook a series of planned post hoc tests because if these are planned a priori, and one does not use more degrees of freedom than in the experiment-wise test (i.e., one is just dividing up the existing degrees of freedom), then P-value correction of post hoc tests is not needed, and so this is much more powerful than undertaking a series of conservative unplanned comparisons""
  - ""Survival analysis was used to analyse the results, which can accommodate nonuniform changes in predation risk with respect to time of day.""
  - ""Each experiment was a randomized block design, where each block comprised a sample of replicates of each treatment, randomly pinned to trees along nonlinear transects 1-3 km long and 20 m wide, using no more than 5% of the available trees and with never more than one target per tree.""
  - ""The experiment followed the same overall procedure as Stevens et al. (2007) and Stevens, Hardman, and Stubbins (2008)""
  - ""We undertook 2 field experiments with artificial gray-scale prey, marked with a pair of white markings presented to wild avian predators, to test the effect of asymmetry on the survival value of conspicuous signals in the field.""",,"- The paper describes two field experiments conducted to test the effect of asymmetry on the survival value of conspicuous signals. This indicates that the study was based on a pre-defined protocol or study plan, as it involved specific experimental designs and statistical analyses.
- The mention of following the same overall procedure as previous studies suggests that there was a structured approach or protocol in place.
- The use of a randomized block design and specific statistical methods like survival analysis indicates a planned approach to the study.
- The mention of planned post hoc tests suggests that the study had a pre-defined plan for data analysis."
