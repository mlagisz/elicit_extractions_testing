Can the way pigs are handled alter behavioural and physiological measures of affective state?,"Ricard Carreras, Laura Arroyo, Eva Mainau, Daniel Valent, Anna Bassols, Antoni Dalmau, Luigi Faucitano, Xavier Manteca, Antonio Velarde",-,-,Behavioural Processes,16,2017,Carreras2017.pdf,no,"  - ""The first and second hypothesis would be supported by the cortisol concentrations, as no differences between handling treatments were found.""
  - ""The present study failed to find an effect of the previous handling experience (positive vs. negative) on the affective state and fear of pigs as assessed through the CBT, NOT and DCT tests, probably due to 1) a real lack of effect of handling on the affective state of pigs; 2) too short and/or insufficiently intense handling sessions; 3) poor validity or the low sensitivity of these behavioural tests to assess such effect; 4) a combination of all these factors.""
  - ""The hypothesis of this study was that pigs with a pH experience have a more optimistic response in the CBT, are less reactive to a sudden stimulus and resume the activity faster in the DCT, are less fearful in the NOT and have lower concentrations of cortisol than pigs with a NH experience.""
  - ""The present study aimed at assessing the effect of pH vs. NH on the pigs' affective state, as assessed by the CBT, and on the fear response, as assessed by the NOT. Furthermore, a DCT was performed to assess the fear response presumably influenced by the affective state.""",,"- The paper does not mention any supplementary materials, supporting materials, appendix, or additional files.

Frontal brain deactivation during a non-verbal cognitive judgement bias test in sheep,"Kathrin Guldimann, Sabine Vögeli, Martin Wolf, Beat Wechsler, Lorenz Gygax",-,-,Brain and Cognition,20,2015,Guldimann2015.pdf,no,"  - ""This project was assessed by the Swiss National Science Foundation, and all procedures have been approved by the Cantonal authority (Canton of Thurgau, permits nos.

  - ""Twenty-nine female non-lactating and non-gestating Lacaune sheep about 2.5 years of age made up the two groups used in this experiment (Vögeli et al., 2014).""
  - ""The sheep from the predictable, stimulus-rich housing conditions reached the final learning criterion faster than the sheep from the unpredictable, stimulus-poor conditions, that is, in a median of 17 versus 37 sessions (Mann-Whitney-U test: W = 112.5, p = 0.02), respectively, and they were more likely to do so (12/12 versus 5/12 sheep, respectively; Fishers-exact test: p = 0.005).""
  - ""The minimum model in the analysed set was the null model, and the maximum model contained the fixed effects housing condition (level with two factors: unpredictable, stimulus-poor; predictable, stimulus-rich), position of the box (continuous relative position), whether or not a go response followed the visual assessment (factor with two levels: no-go and go reaction), the time course throughout the stimulation (a spline based on time coded as a continuous variable), location of the measurement paths on the head (lateral position: indicator for left versus right hemisphere; longitudinal position: indicator for cranial versus caudal location; measurement depth: deep versus superficial measurement) and all their possible interactions.""
  - ""The complete set of models analysed therefore included 24 models.""
  - ""Our measurements of frontal brain activation by using fNIRS seemed to indicate frontal brain processes specific to the visual assessment of the choice area the sheep were about to enter in the cognitive judgement bias test.""
  - ""In conclusion, it seems that (1) sheep from the unpredictable, stimulus-poor in comparison with sheep from the predictable, stimulus-rich housing conditions dealt less easily with the test conditions rich in stimuli as seen in the number of trials needed to reach the learning criterion and the likelihood that they reached this criterion, that (2) long-term housing conditions seemingly did not influence mood, which may be related to the difficulty of monitoring a constant long-term state, and that (3) visual assessment of an emotional stimulus leads to frontal brain deactivation in sheep, specifically when that stimulus is negative.""","  - ""(Page 5, Table 1) Below is a rendering of the page up to the first error.```\n| Model structure         | Delta BIC | Model probability |      E₀      |\n|-------------------------|-----------|-------------------|--------------|""","- The paper provides detailed information about the experimental setup, procedures, and statistical analyses used in the study.
