Can the way pigs are handled alter behavioural and physiological measures of affective state?,"Ricard Carreras, Laura Arroyo, Eva Mainau, Daniel Valent, Anna Bassols, Antoni Dalmau, Luigi Faucitano, Xavier Manteca, Antonio Velarde",-,-,Behavioural Processes,16,2017,Carreras2017.pdf,no,"  - ""The present study failed to find an effect of the previous handling experience (positive vs. negative) on the affective state and fear of pigs as assessed through the CBT, NOT and DCT tests, probably due to 1) a real lack of effect of handling on the affective state of pigs; 2) too short and/or insufficiently intense handling sessions; 3) poor validity or the low sensitivity of these behavioural tests to assess such effect; 4) a combination of all these factors.""
  - ""The hypothesis of this study was that pigs with a pH experience have a more optimistic response in the CBT, are less reactive to a sudden stimulus and resume the activity faster in the DCT, are less fearful in the NOT and have lower concentrations of cortisol than pigs with a NH experience.""
  - ""The present study aimed at assessing the effect of pH vs. NH on the pigs' affective state, as assessed by the CBT, and on the fear response, as assessed by the NOT. Furthermore, a DCT was performed to assess the fear response presumably influenced by the affective state.""",,"- The paper provides a detailed description of the study's objectives, methods, and results, but it does not mention the specific roles or contributions of the authors.

Frontal brain deactivation during a non-verbal cognitive judgement bias test in sheep,"Kathrin Guldimann, Sabine Vögeli, Martin Wolf, Beat Wechsler, Lorenz Gygax",-,-,Brain and Cognition,20,2015,Guldimann2015.pdf,yes,"  - ""This project was assessed by the Swiss National Science Foundation, and all procedures have been approved by the Cantonal authority (Canton of Thurgau, permits nos. F6/10 and F4/11 for conducting animal experiments).""
  - ""Twenty-nine female non-lactating and non-gestating Lacaune sheep about 2.5 years of age made up the two groups used in this experiment (Vögeli et al., 2014).""
  - ""24 focal sheep (12 from each housing group) that had previously been chosen at random were included in the cognitive judgement bias test.""
  - ""R version 3.1.0 (R Core Team, 2014) was used for all statistical analyses.""
  - ""Model selection was performed by using model probabilities (weights) based on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC; Gygax et al., 2013) using an all-subset strategy in modelling the go/no-go response (function dredge in package MuMIn; Barton, 2014) and a specific set of models in evaluating the fNIRS reaction (modified function aictab in package AICcmodavg; Mazerolle, 2013).""
  - ""The sheep from the predictable, stimulus-rich housing conditions reached the final learning criterion faster than the sheep from the unpredictable, stimulus-poor conditions, that is, in a median of 17 versus 37 sessions (Mann-Whitney-U test: W = 112.5, p = 0.02), respectively, and they were more likely to do so (12/12 versus 5/12 sheep, respectively; Fishers-exact test: p = 0.005).""
  - ""Our measurements of frontal brain activation by using fNIRS seemed to indicate frontal brain processes specific to the visual assessment of the choice area the sheep were about to enter in the cognitive judgement bias test.""
  - ""In conclusion, it seems that (1) sheep from the unpredictable, stimulus-poor in comparison with sheep from the predictable, stimulus-rich housing conditions dealt less easily with the test conditions rich in stimuli as seen in the number of trials needed to reach the learning criterion and the likelihood that they reached this criterion, that (2) long-term housing conditions seemingly did not influence mood, which may be related to the difficulty of monitoring a constant long-term state, and that (3) visual assessment of an emotional stimulus leads to frontal brain deactivation in sheep, specifically when that stimulus is negative.""",,"- The paper provides detailed information about the experimental design, data collection, and statistical analysis, which suggests that the authors were involved in these aspects of the study.
- The mention of specific statistical software and methods (e.g., R version 3.1.0, model selection using BIC) indicates that the authors were responsible for data analysis.
- The description of the experimental setup and procedures (e.g., housing conditions, cognitive judgement bias test) suggests that the authors were involved in designing and conducting the experiment.
- The paper does not explicitly state the roles or contributions of each author, but it implies that they were collectively involved in the research design, data collection, and analysis."

  - ""We trained individual adult males to 'go' to a specific location within 30 s when a positive auditory cue (whistle; CS+) was given in order to receive cassava root pieces as a reward, and to 'no-go' when a negative cue (caxixi percussion instrument; CS-) was sounded to avoid punishment (jet of water) and no reward.""
