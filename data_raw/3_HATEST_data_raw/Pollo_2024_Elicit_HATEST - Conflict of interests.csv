All authors contributed critically to the drafts and gave final approval for publication.""",,"- The paper does not explicitly mention any conflict of interests or disclose any potential conflicts.
- The authors' roles and contributions are detailed, but there is no section or statement addressing conflicts of interests.
- The absence of a specific declaration or section on conflicts of interests suggests that it was not declared specifically."

The relative importance of size and asymmetry in sexual selection,"R Thornhid', A P M0ller, A P Moller",-,-,,88,1998,Thornhill_1998.pdf,not declared specifically,"  - ""the sample used in the present study (because it contained only studies with information on effects of both character size and symmetry) may have been somewhat biased toward a weak effect Obviously, a sample with a weak effect of symmetry would be conservative in the sense that it would make any difference between the effect size of size and asymmetry more difficult to detect.""
  - ""All the data are presented in Table 1""
  - ""We were able to obtain unpublished correlation coefficients for character size for a few additional studies that were also included in this study.""
  - ""The data set used for the present study is from Mailer and Thornhill (1998), which was based on (1) a comprehensive search of the literature and of the Internet for information on the relationship between asymmetry and sexual selection, and (2) correspondence between the authors and behavioral ecologists conducting research on this relationship.""",,"- The paper does not explicitly mention any conflict of interests or disclose any potential conflicts.
- The authors mention using data from a previous study by Mailer and Thornhill (1998), which suggests a potential connection between the authors and the data source, but this does not necessarily imply a conflict of interest.
- The mention of obtaining unpublished correlation coefficients could suggest some level of collaboration or access to data that might not be available to others, but again, this is not explicitly stated as a conflict of interest.
- The paper does not include a section or statement specifically addressing conflicts of interests, which is common in scientific publications to disclose any potential biases or financial interests."
