"Persistence of a plasma melatonin rhythm in constant darkness and its inhibition by constant light in the sleepy lizard, Tiliqua rugosa","Bruce T Firth, Ingrid Belan, David J Kennaway",-,-,Journal of Pineal Research,11,2006,Firth_2006.pdf,not declared specifically,"  - ""In conclusion, this investigation demonstrates that the blood plasma melatonin rhythm in sleepy lizards is present for several days in constant temperature and darkness, indicating that this is a true circadian rhythm.""
  - ""We conclude that the disparity between the present and past results is due to a combination of the abovementioned factors.""
  - ""The difference between our present and previous results could be due to at least three factors.""
  - ""The present study suggests that the blood plasma melatonin rhythm of T. rugosa is a circadian rhythm because it persists in a constant photothermal environment.""",,"- The paper discusses the persistence of a plasma melatonin rhythm in constant darkness and its inhibition by constant light in the sleepy lizard, Tiliqua rugosa.
- The authors compare their current findings with previous studies, indicating a change in methodology or understanding.

"Studies on Pineal Melatonin Levels in a Diurnal Species, the Eastern Chipmunk (Tamias striatus): Effects of Light at Night, Propranolol Administration or Superior Cervical Ganglionectomy","R J Reiter, T S King, B A Richardson, E C Hurlbut",-,-,Journal of neural transmission,15,2005,Reiter_1982.pdf,not declared specifically,"  - ""The findings are consistent with the idea that fl-adrenergic receptors may not be involved with mediating the nocturnal increase in pineal melatonin in the chipmunk.""
  - ""The present results confirm our earlier observation that the nocturnal rise in pineal melatonin levels in the chipmunk is not inhibited by exposure to normal room light (Reiter et al., 1982).""
  - ""The inability ofpropranolol to prevent the rise in pineal melatonin could be related to the rapid metabolism of the drug although this seems unlikely since even within 2hours after drug administration the pineal content of melatonin was not inhibited.""
  - ""On the other hand, it seems clear that the rise (both when chipmunks are exposed to darkness or light at night) in pineal melatonin involves the peripheral sympathetic nervous system.""
  - ""The exposure of the wild-captured rodents to sunlight which has a much greater intensity (up to 1,000,000 lux) (Thorington, 1980) may have possibly rendered their pineal relatively insensitive to low intensity room light, i.e., 4,000 lux (Rivest r al., 1981; Lynch et aL, 1981;Reiter et al., 1982).""",,"- The paper does not explicitly mention any conflict of interests or disclose any potential conflicts.
- The references to previous studies by the same authors (e.g., Reiter et al., 1982) suggest a continuity of research but do not indicate a conflict of interest.
- The discussion of potential explanations for the findings, such as the rapid metabolism of propranolol or the role of the sympathetic nervous system, is part of the scientific analysis and does not imply a conflict of interest.
- The paper does not include a section or statement specifically addressing conflicts of interest, which is typically where such information would be disclosed."
