- The mention of ""no statistical differences between males and females"" further supports that both sexes were included and analyzed separately to ensure that gender did not influence the results."

  - ""The sex ratio in raised zebrafish was approximately 1:1, male zebrafish were chosen for this series of experiments due to the previous identification of sex specific effects of ATZ in 6 mpf male zebrafish [52].""
  - ""We evaluated the performance of 9 mpf male zebrafish in a battery of three neurobehavioral tests of anxiety, the novel tank test (NTT), the light dark box (LDB), and an open field test (OFT) to determine if embryonic ATZ exposure causes functional changes in neurobehavior.""
  - ""At 9 mpf, 10 male zebrafish (considered subsamples) were randomly chosen from each of 4 biological replicates (N=4, with a total of 40 zebrafish per treatment analyzed; biological replicate defined as zebrafish grown from separate clutches) to undergo a battery of three behavioral tests: the Novel Tank Test (NTT), the Light-Dark Box (LDB), and the Open Field Test (OFT).""",,"- The paper explicitly states that the study focused on ""adult male zebrafish behavior,"" indicating that the sex of the zebrafish used in the experiment was male.
- The experimental design involved selecting ""10 male zebrafish"" for each treatment group, further confirming that only male zebrafish were used.
- The mention of a ""sex ratio in raised zebrafish was approximately 1:1"" suggests that both male and female zebrafish were present in the overall population, but only males were chosen for this specific study.
- The rationale for choosing male zebrafish was due to previous findings of sex-specific effects in males, reinforcing that the study was conducted using male zebrafish."

  - ""Zebrafish embryos were collected at the beginning of the 14-h light cycle on the morning following the pairing of same strain adult breeders.""
  - ""Zebrafish (Danio rerio) from two wild-type strains, AB* and 5D, were maintained in a colony room at approximately 28.5°C on a 14:10-h light/dark cycle.""",,"- The paper describes the use of zebrafish embryos and larvae for the experiment, which implies that the sex of the zebrafish was not a factor in the study since embryos and larvae are not sexually differentiated.
- The paper does not mention the sex of the zebrafish used in the experiment, as it focuses on developmental exposure and behavioral effects rather than sexual differences.
- The use of embryos and larvae suggests that the study was conducted before sexual differentiation occurred in the zebrafish, making sex not a relevant factor in the experiment."
Quantitative assessment of cypermethrin induced behavioural and biochemical anomalies in adult zebrafish,"Shubham Nema, Yogesh Bhargava",-,-,Neurotoxicology and Teratology,21,2018,nema_2018.pdf,both/mixed,"  - ""Adult zebrafish (Danio rerio as GloFish™) of mixed gender were purchased from a local commercial supplier and maintained in the Open-RAC recirculating zebrafish maintenance system (Nema and Bhargava, 2017).""
  - ""adult zebrafish of mixed gender were randomly selected from their housing tank and gently transferred to two tanks viz. the control tank containing no cypermethrin and the treatment tank containing 25 μg/L of cypermethrin as final concentration.""",,"- The paper explicitly states that the zebrafish used in the experiment were of ""mixed gender,"" which indicates that both male and female zebrafish were included in the study.
- The use of ""mixed gender"" is consistent throughout the description of the experimental setup, confirming that the study did not focus on a single sex but rather included both male and female zebrafish."
