  - ""We collected data on maximum body size (final instar body length, in cm) and the presence or absence of eyespots in final instar hawkmoth caterpillars from a range of reliable online databases, field guides, direct observations, and other publications (detailed in Table S2""
  - ""The data matrix has a significantly expanded taxon set from a previously published study (31) (Dataset S1).""",,"- The paper mentions that the data matrix is included as ""Dataset S1,"" which suggests that some form of data is shared in supplementary materials.
- The mention of ""Table S2"" indicates that additional data or information is provided in supplementary tables, which are typically part of the supplementary materials.

Field experiments on the effectiveness of 'eyespots' as predator deterrents,"Martin Stevens, Elinor Hopkins, William Hinde, Amabel Adcock, Yvonne Connolly, Tom Troscianko, Innes C Cuthill, K T Troscianko",-,-,-,-,-,Stevens_2007.pdf,no,"  - ""Effect sizes are given by the odds ratio, which is simply the ratio of the probability of predation in one treatment to the probability of predation in another treatment.""
  - ""Survival analysis for all experiments was performed via Cox proportional hazards regression (Cox 1972;Lawless 2002;Klein & Moeschberger 2003), which can accommodate censored data and the nonuniform change in predation risk with respect to time of day.""
  - ""The general methodology for calibrating the grey-scale targets was similar to Stevens et al. (2006)""
  - ""The results from our experiments were influenced by the method of determining the value of the grey wing background on which the eyespots were placed, showing that the local contrast values used in an experiment can have a key impact on the results obtained from such a study.""",,"- The paper provides detailed descriptions of the methodology and statistical analysis used in the experiments, which suggests that the data collection and analysis processes are well-documented.

Significance of butterfly eyespots as an anti-predator device in ground-based and aerial attacks,"Anne Lyytinen, Paul M Brakefield, Johanna Mappes",-,-,,93,2003,Lyytinen_2003.pdf,yes,"  - ""The fate of butterflies (% 9 SE) and the proportion of initial attacks (% 9 SE) that lizards (n = 16) directed to the wings in spotless, spotted, and Bigeye-comet butterflies.""","  - ""(Page 4, Table 2) | Butterfly form | The fate                  | The target       | \n|----------------|---------------------------|------------------|\n|                | Eaten | Escaped with wing damage | Wings | The body |""

These tables contain specific percentages and standard errors related to the fate of butterflies and the targets of attacks by predators.
- The tables are included in the paper itself, which means the data is shared directly within the article.
- There is no mention of external links or supplementary materials where additional data might be found, nor is there any indication that data is available on request.

The position of eyespots and thickened segments influence their protective value to caterpillars,"John Skelhorn, Giles Dorrington, Thomas J Hossie, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,,16,2014,Skelhorn_2014.pdf,yes,"  - ""Supplementary material can be found at http://www.beheco. oxfordjournals.org/""",,"- The paper mentions that supplementary material can be found at a specific URL, which suggests that additional data or materials related to the study are available online.

"The protective value of conspicuous signals is not impaired by shape, size, or position asymmetry","Martin Stevens, Sarah A Castor-Perry, Jessica R F Price",-,-,,19,2009,Stevens&CastorPerry_2009.pdf,no,"  - ""In both experiments, and in line with previous work (Stevens et al. 2007; Stevens, Hardman, and Stubbins 2008) , simple continuously visible markings enhanced the survival of conspicuous artificial prey in the field.""
  - ""Survival analysis was used to analyse the results, which can accommodate nonuniform changes in predation risk with respect to time of day.""
  - ""Survival analysis is ideally suited to accommodate censored values (here nonavian predation, lost targets, and survival to the end of a block), which still provide information on those replicates up until the time point at which a nonavian predation event occurred.""
  - ""Effect sizes are odds ratios (OR), which are the ratio of the odds of an event (e.g., predation) occurring in one group (treatment) to the odds of it occurring in another group, where the odds in a group is given by P/(1 2 P), where P is the probability of an event.""
  - ""We undertook a series of planned post hoc tests because if these are planned a priori, and one does not use more degrees of freedom than in the experiment-wise test (i.e., one is just dividing up the existing degrees of freedom), then P-value correction of post hoc tests is not needed, and so this is much more powerful than undertaking a series of conservative unplanned comparisons (Rosenthal et al. 2000;Ruxton and Beauchamp 2008).""

  - ""There was a total of 58 (17.3%) censored targets.""",,"- The paper provides detailed descriptions of the experimental design, data analysis methods, and results, including survival analysis and odds ratios.
