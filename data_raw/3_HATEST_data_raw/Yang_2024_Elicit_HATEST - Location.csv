- Since the question asks for the country where the experiment was conducted or animals were collected, and the paper specifies that the collection occurred in South Australia, the answer is Australia."
Role of light wavelengths in synchronization of circadian physiology in songbirds,"G Yadav, S Malik, S Rani, V Kumar",-,-,Physiology and Behavior,21,2015,Yadav_2015.pdf,India,"  - ""Bunting is a Palearctic-Indian migrant, with the breeding grounds in west Asia and east Europe. It arrives in India (~25°N) in late September/October, overwinters, and returns to its breeding grounds located around ~40°N in late March/ April [1].""
  - ""On the other hand, Indian weaver birds are a resident species.""
  - ""For this study, birds were captured in late February, brought to the laboratory and acclimated to captive conditions for a week in an outdoor aviary (size = 3 × 2.5 × 2.5 m).""",,"- The paper mentions that the blackheaded bunting migrates to India (~25°N) for overwintering, which suggests that the study might have been conducted in India, as the birds were captured in late February, a time when they would be present in India.
- The mention of the Indian weaver bird as a resident species further supports the idea that the study was conducted in India, as these birds are native to the region.
- There is no explicit mention of the country where the experiment was conducted, but the context provided about the bird species and their habitats suggests India as the likely location."
"Studies on Pineal Melatonin Levels in a Diurnal Species, the Eastern Chipmunk (Tamias striatus): Effects of Light at Night, Propranolol Administration or Superior Cervical Ganglionectomy","R J Reiter, T S King, B A Richardson, E C Hurlbut",-,-,Journal of neural transmission,15,2005,Reiter_1982.pdf,United States,"  - ""Upon arrival, the animals were housed 5-7 per clear polycarbonate cage and given food (Wayne-Lab Blox) and water adlibiturn. During the period of acclimation the light : dark cycle was maintained at 14:10; lights were automatically turned off daily at 8 p.m. All animals were acclimated to the laboratory conditions for at least 1 week before being used in a given experiment.""
  - ""Adult male and female Eastern chipmunks were obtained from central Wisconsin during the months of June-September.""",,"- The paper mentions that the Eastern chipmunks were obtained from central Wisconsin, which indicates that the animals were collected from this location.
- The mention of ""Upon arrival"" suggests that the animals were transported to another location for the experiments, but the country where the experiments were conducted is not explicitly mentioned.
- Since the first author's country is not explicitly mentioned in the paper, and the animals were collected from Wisconsin, we can infer that the study location is likely the United States, as Wisconsin is a state in the U.S."
