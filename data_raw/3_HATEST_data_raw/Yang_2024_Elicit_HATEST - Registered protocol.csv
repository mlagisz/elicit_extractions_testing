Role of light wavelengths in synchronization of circadian physiology in songbirds,"G Yadav, S Malik, S Rani, V Kumar",-,-,Physiology and Behavior,21,2015,Yadav_2015.pdf,no,"  - ""Here, we tested whether songbirds belonging to different family groups that are phylogenetically close [2] but adapted to the different latitudes and exhibit differences in the life history states, would respond similarly and exhibit wavelength-dependent circadian responses if they were presented with short and long light wavelengths at identical duration and equal irradiance (energy level).""
  - ""The prediction was that both species would respond similarly, and interpret 12 h blue and red light periods as the day and night, respectively, should the spectral sensitivity of photoreceptors mediating photoperiodism was a conserved trait among photoperiodic birds.""
  - ""This study included two photoperiodic songbirds, the blackheaded bunting (E. melanocephala) and Indian weaver bird (P. philippinus), which breed at distinctly different latitudes but share the same latitudes and environment for almost half of the year [1].""
  - ""Birds were initially kept on 8L:16D. On day 4, they were exposed to 12L:12D (L = 0.33 μM/m 2 /s, D = 0 μM/m 2 /s) by delaying the light offset by 4 h.""
  - ""After about two weeks, birds were released in constant light (LL) at identical light energy levels for two weeks to induce arrhythmicity in the circadian activity behavior.""
  - ""At this stage, they were distributed in two groups of each species (groups 1 and 2; n = 7 or 9 each) and subjected to spectral regimes (450 nm: blue, B; 640 nm: red, R) with identical light duration (12 h) and energy level (0.33 μM/m 2 /s).""
  - ""The 12L:12D was replaced with 12B:12R (group 1) or 12R:12B (group 2). After two weeks, the wavelength pattern was phase-inversed for another two weeks; group 1 -12R:12B, and group 2 -12B:12R.""

  - ""All animals were acclimated to the laboratory conditions for at least 1 week before being used in a given experiment.""
  - ""A total of 199 chipmunks were used in these studies.""
  - ""Experiment i. Since a previously published report had established that the normal nocturnal rise in pineal NAT and melatonin in the chipmunk is not prevented by the exposure of these animals to light at night (Reiter et al., 1982), the first study was designed to determine whether propranolol, aft-adrenergic blocking agent, could prevent the rise in pineal melatonin in chipmunks exposed either to dark or light during the normal dark period.""
  - ""Experiment 2. The results of Experiment 1 indicated that fl-adrenergic blockade was without influence on pineal melatonin levels.""
