Economic analysis of the health impacts of housing improvement studies: a systematic review,"Elisabeth Fenwick, Catriona Macdonald, Hilary Thomson",-,-,Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health,35,2013,Fenwick_2013.pdf,no,"  - ""The health outcomes reported included validated measures, for example SF-36, and selfreported measures, and covered four main domains: general health; mental health; respiratory health; and other/illness and symptoms.""
  - ""Studies which present cost data without economic evaluation""
  - ""Studies which reported having undertaken an economic evaluation (table 3""
  - ""The findings from all three studies suggested net economic benefits associated with the interventions based on the outcomes measured in monetary terms""
  - ""The absence of long term health impacts limits the potential for economic analysis.""
  - ""The specific form of the evaluation would depend on the measure of health outcome collected with data such as SF-36, EQ-5D, etc used to determine QALYs for a cost-utility analysis, monetary values of health outcome used within a cost-benefit analysis and other measures of health/ clinical outcome used within a cost-effectiveness analysis (see table 1""",,"QUOTES:

- ""The study design and methodological quality of the studies varied, as assessed by the original systematic review criteria. These studies reported a diverse range of health outcomes, and the reported impacts suggest either improvement or no change in health status following housing improvement during the study period (see supplementary table 1).""

REASONING:

- The paper mentions ""supplementary table 1"" in the context of discussing the study design and methodological quality of the studies included in the review.
- The mention of ""supplementary table 1"" suggests that there are supplementary materials associated with the paper, which may include additional data or details not included in the main text.
- However, there is no explicit mention of online supplementary materials or additional files accessible through links or stored separately."

Latent heat storage in building elements: A systematic review on properties and contextual performance factors,"A Mavrigiannaki, E Ampatzi",-,-,,78,2016,Mavrigiannaki_2016.pdf,yes,"  - ""The review of a total of 120 papers revealed that published information on these aspects is diverse and in many cases insufficient.""
  - ""The diversity of test conditions and variety of reported values indicate that physical properties and performance data concerning materials and complete PCM elements are not directly comparable.""
  - ""The systematic review has further revealed that information on the above mentioned aspects is deficient.""
  - ""The results highlight areas where future research would be beneficial in broadening our understanding of the actual potential held by these technologies in energy and carbon reductions from heating and cooling.""
  - ""At the moment of writing matching technologies and applications for specific climates and building typologies is not possible solely through published information.""
  - ""Further research is needed to enrich the knowledge base and enable a broader mapping of performance aspects that could guide design.""",,"- The paper discusses the diversity and insufficiency of published information on latent heat storage in building elements, which suggests a lack of comprehensive data or supplementary materials.
- The systematic review highlights the need for future research to fill gaps in understanding, indicating that current literature may not provide additional supplementary materials.
- The paper does not mention any specific supplementary materials, such as online links or additional files, that would provide further details beyond the published content."
Online engagement for sustainable energy projects: A Systematic review and framework for integration,Danielle Barrios-O'neill,-,-,,34,2016,Barrios-ONeill_2016.pdf,no,"  - ""The selection of NS for use in this study reflects the need to create thematic coherence among data sets (both qualitative and quantitative), in order to categorise key areas of challenge and relevant solutions, in a largely unexplored, interdisciplinary area.""
  - ""The 73 selected papers, discussing potential challenges and solutions relevant to the area of engagement with energy sustainability, were compiled and studied for relationships suggesting common themes or categories (see Popay, 2006 , ""thematic analysis"", p. 18).""

  - ""Moreover, due to the limited full text access that our University provided, we were also unable to retrieve the studies from the hand searching of reference lists.""
  - ""It was beyond the scope of the review to locate unpublished research or grey literature.""
  - ""We also hand searched the reference lists of the publications selected for quality assessment but we were unable to retrieve the full texts because of the limited access the Library Center of Medical University Plovdiv provided at that moment [Table 1""",,"- The paper mentions that due to limited access, they were unable to retrieve full texts from hand-searched reference lists, which implies that there might be additional materials or references they could not access.
- The authors state that it was beyond the scope of the review to include unpublished research or grey literature, which suggests that they did not include supplementary materials from these sources.
- There is no mention of any supplementary materials being included with the article, such as additional files or online links.
