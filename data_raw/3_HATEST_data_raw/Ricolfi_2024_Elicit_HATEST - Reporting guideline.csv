(2021).""
  - ""The methods used in this systematic review were previously described in detail in a peer-reviewed protocol (DeLuca et al., 2021) and are based on those described in U.S. EPA's Systematic Review Protocol for the PFBA, PFHxA, PFHxS, PFNA, and PFDA IRIS Assessments (U.S. EPA, 2019) and the Navigation Guide (Woodruff et al., 2011;Woodruff and Sutton, 2014;Johnson et al., 2014;Lam et al., 2016).""
  - ""The systematic review was conducted following a previously published protocol (DeLuca et al., 2021) that describes the systematic review methodology used in detail.""",,"- The paper explicitly states that the systematic review was conducted following a previously published protocol (DeLuca et al., 2021), which suggests adherence to a specific guideline or checklist for conducting the review.
- The methods used in the review are based on protocols from the U.S. EPA and the Navigation Guide, indicating that these guidelines were followed during the review process.
- The use of modified versions of tools for risk of bias and strength of evidence assessment, as described in the EPA's Systematic Review Protocol, further supports the claim that specific guidelines were followed.
- The mention of these protocols and guidelines suggests that the review claims to follow specific reporting and conduct guidelines."
Legacy and emerging pollutants in Latin America: A critical review of occurrence and levels in environmental and food samples,"Cristina Marília,  Oliveira Souza, Bruno Alves Rocha, Joseph A Adeyemi, Martí Nadal, José Luis Domingo, Fernando Barbosa, Damià Barceló",-,-,Science of the Total Environment,54,2022,Souza_2022.pdf,no,"  - ""Conference documents, review papers, and manuscripts not published in English were not included in the present review since they did not follow the above-mentioned points.""
  - ""The selection of articles for this review was carried out according to the following relevant points: i) a complete description of the matrices, like geographical localization, collection, and storage of samples; ii) an adequate number of analyzed samples, according to the type of the sample (the amount depends on the sample type); iii) analytical methods described with appropriate quality control (QA/QC) methodology.""",,"- The paper describes specific criteria for selecting articles, such as complete description of matrices, adequate sample size, and appropriate analytical methods with quality control. This suggests a structured approach to selecting studies for the review.
- However, there is no explicit mention of a specific reporting guideline or checklist being followed for the conduct of the review itself. The criteria mentioned are more about the selection of studies rather than the reporting of the review.
- The paper does not mention any specific reporting guideline like PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) or other similar guidelines."
Organic Contaminants in Chinese Sewage Sludge: A Meta-Analysis of the Literature of the Past 30 Years,"Xiang-Zhou Meng, Arjun K Venkatesan, Yi-Lin Ni, Joshua C Steele, Ling-Ling Wu, Anders Bignert, Åke Bergman, Rolf U Halden",-,-,Environmental Science and Technology,155,2016,Meng_2016.pdf,no,"  - ""The objectives were to (i) examine the temporal and spatial distributions of all previous work, (ii) reveal the identity and concentration of important and abundant OCs in Chinese sludge, and (iii) assess the potential need for conducting a Chinese national sewage sludge survey.""
  - ""In this study, we present the first systematic review and a meta-analysis of OCs in Chinese sludge based on the literature published over the past 30 years.""",,"- The paper describes itself as a ""systematic review and a meta-analysis,"" which implies adherence to specific guidelines for conducting such reviews.
- The objectives of the study are clearly outlined, which is a common practice in systematic reviews to ensure transparency and reproducibility.
- However, the paper does not explicitly mention following a specific reporting guideline or checklist, such as PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) or MOOSE (Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology).
- The absence of an explicit mention of a reporting guideline suggests that the paper may not have followed a specific guideline, but this is not definitive without further information."

  - ""The inclusion of published reviews in the current paper was not straightforward in all cases.""
  - ""The inclusion criteria and other methods of the included reviews varied. Furthermore, many reviews highlighted the heterogeneity of the individual studies.""
  - ""The literature searches were not conducted in a manner that fulfilled the criteria of a systematic review. This is a scoping literature review [14], which summarizes epidemiological studies on the associations of ADHD and HBM4EU priority substances, or their possible associations, which justify further research.""",,"- The paper explicitly states that it is a ""scoping literature review,"" which implies that it does not follow the same rigorous guidelines as a systematic review.
- The authors mention that the literature searches were not conducted in a manner that fulfills the criteria of a systematic review, indicating a deviation from standard systematic review guidelines.
- The paper does not mention any specific reporting guidelines or checklists that it follows, such as PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) or other similar guidelines.
