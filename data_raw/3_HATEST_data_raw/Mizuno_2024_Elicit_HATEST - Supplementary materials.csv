Body size affects the evolution of eyespots in caterpillars,"Thomas John Hossie, John Skelhorn, Jesse W Breinholt, Akito Y Kawahara, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,50,2015,Hossie_2015.pdf,yes,"  - ""Classifying only prey recovered with peck marks as killed (i.e., considering all missing prey as censored) produced qualitatively similar results (SI Materials and Methods).""
  - ""Further inspection of the data suggest that the strength of the eyespots × body size interaction in the field experiment varied considerably among microhabitats in which the caterpillar models were placed (SI Materials and Methods).""
  - ""We collected data on maximum body size (final instar body length, in cm) and the presence or absence of eyespots in final instar hawkmoth caterpillars from a range of reliable online databases, field guides, direct observations, and other publications (detailed in Table S2""
  - ""The data matrix has a significantly expanded taxon set from a previously published study (31) (Dataset S1).""
  - ""Insectivorous bird species observed in each of the field locations are detailed in Table S3""
  - ""The entire process was repeated six times, for a total of 576 artificial prey deployed. Each consecutive replicate was conducted in an entirely new location within one of the three larger sites and was at least 200 m from any previous location within that site. To avoid temporal confounding among sites, consecutive replicates were always conducted at a different site in a systematic order (i.e., site 1, location 1; site 2, location 1; site 3, location 1; site 1, location 2, etc.).""
  - ""The importance of the three-way interaction was evaluated by comparing the fit of the full model (size × eyespot × approach) with and without the three-way interaction, using the log-likelihood ratio test.""",,"- The paper mentions ""SI Materials and Methods"" multiple times, indicating that there are supplementary materials that provide additional details on methods and data.

  - ""The general methodology for calibrating the grey-scale targets was similar to Stevens et al. (2006)""",,"- The paper references other studies and methodologies, such as Stevens et al.

Significance of butterfly eyespots as an anti-predator device in ground-based and aerial attacks,"Anne Lyytinen, Paul M Brakefield, Johanna Mappes",-,-,,93,2003,Lyytinen_2003.pdf,no,"  - ""In our experiments, lizards and birds preyed upon butterflies which were at rest or feeding on a banana slice, and hence the possible differences in activity levels or escape efficiency of butterfly forms did not influence the results.""
  - ""We did not find eyespots to be advantageous to butterflies when the attack came from the ground level or from above.""
  - ""In contrast to our result, Wourms and Wasserman (1985) found a significant advantage of possessing eyespot pattern.""

The Feeding Behaviour of Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) in the Presence of 'Eyes',"I R Inglis, L W Huson, M B Marshall, P A Arid,  Neville",-,-,-,-,-,Inglis_1983.pdf,no,"  - ""The experimental procedure was designed to provide a relevant and objective, interval scale of aversiveness based upon the ability of eye patterns to deter hungry birds from a feeding area.""
  - ""The 10 measures were analysed using principal component analysis and the first component in every experiment had the signs of the latent vectors of the variables exactly in the predicted pattern and therefore appeared to be a n 'aversiveness index'.""
  - ""The scores from this first component were then used in a Latin square ANOVA to distinguish subject, test order and stimulus effects.""
  - ""The 10 behavioural measures taken were as follows: 1. The time in s that the bird spent feeding. 2. The time in s that the bird spent on the trough regardless of whether it was feeding or not.""
  - ""The approach adopted is the construction of an index of aversiveness from the response variates measured.""
  - ""The use of these scores has the additional advantage that, being linear combinations of random variables they will asymptotically have a normal distribution.""",,"- The paper provides detailed descriptions of the experimental procedures, data analysis methods, and results, but there is no mention of supplementary materials, supporting materials, appendices, or additional files.
- The paper includes tables and figures within the main text, which are standard for presenting data and results, but these are not referred to as supplementary materials.
