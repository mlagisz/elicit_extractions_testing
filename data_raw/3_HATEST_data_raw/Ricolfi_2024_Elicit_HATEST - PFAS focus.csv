ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANT EXPOSURES AND PRETERM BIRTH: A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW,"Kelly K Ferguson, Marie S O'neill, John D Meeker",-,-,"Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health. Part B, Critical Reviews",148,2013,Ferguson_2013.pdf,no,"  - ""Overall, the current literature examining associations between environmental contaminant exposures and preterm birth indicates suggestive evidence for effects of some exposures, while results for others are inconclusive:

(1) For POP, evidence is strong for a relationship between DDE exposure at high levels and preterm birth. Data are suggestive for DDE at lower levels and also for PFC, particularly in studies where biomarkers of exposure were used.""
  - ""A number of recent studies examined the relationship between PFOA and PFOS exposure and preterm birth.""
  - ""Perfluorinated chemicals repel oil, grease, and water and are used to treat carpets and clothing to prevent stains, and are also components of some food containers and wrappers (ATSDR, 2009) . Through product use and manufacturing they can be released into the environment, and do not degrade in soil or water. Exposure occurs through consumption of contaminated drinking water and food, inadvertent ingestion of indoor dust, and potentially through inhalation (ATSDR, 2009) . The two compounds produced in largest quantities include perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS).""
  - ""Using PubMed searches, studies were identified that examined associations between preterm birth and exposure to five categories of environmental toxicants, including persistent organic pollutants, drinking-water contaminants, atmospheric pollutants, metals and metalloids, and other environmental contaminants.""
  - ""This is a comprehensive review of all known studies published from 1992 through August 2012 linking maternal exposure to environmental chemicals during pregnancy with preterm birth.""",,"- The paper is a comprehensive review of studies linking maternal exposure to various environmental chemicals with preterm birth, indicating it covers a broad range of chemicals.
- The review includes five categories of environmental toxicants, which suggests a broad focus rather than a specific focus on PFAS.
- The paper does discuss PFAS, specifically PFOA and PFOS, indicating that PFAS are included in the review.
- The mention of ""suggestive evidence for effects of some exposures"" and specific mention of PFC (which includes PFAS) suggests that PFAS are part of the review but not the sole focus."
