Can the way pigs are handled alter behavioural and physiological measures of affective state?,"Ricard Carreras, Laura Arroyo, Eva Mainau, Daniel Valent, Anna Bassols, Antoni Dalmau, Luigi Faucitano, Xavier Manteca, Antonio Velarde",-,-,Behavioural Processes,16,2017,Carreras2017.pdf,yes,"  - ""The present study failed to find an effect of the previous handling experience (positive vs. negative) on the affective state and fear of pigs as assessed through the CBT, NOT and DCT tests, probably due to 1) a real lack of effect of handling on the affective state of pigs; 2) too short and/or insufficiently intense handling sessions; 3) poor validity or the low sensitivity of these behavioural tests to assess such effect; 4) a combination of all these factors.""
  - ""The hypothesis of this study was that pigs with a pH experience have a more optimistic response in the CBT, are less reactive to a sudden stimulus and resume the activity faster in the DCT, are less fearful in the NOT and have lower concentrations of cortisol than pigs with a NH experience.""
  - ""The present study aimed at assessing the effect of pH vs. NH on the pigs' affective state, as assessed by the CBT, and on the fear response, as assessed by the NOT. Furthermore, a DCT was performed to assess the fear response presumably influenced by the affective state.""
  - ""The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of IRTA.""",,"- The paper mentions that the study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), which suggests that there was some form of protocol or plan in place for the study.
- The study had a clear hypothesis and objectives, indicating that there was a pre-defined protocol or study plan.
- The paper does not explicitly mention whether the study was registered or pre-registered, but the presence of a hypothesis and approval from an ethics committee suggests that there was a structured plan in place."
"Does stocking density modify affective state in pigs as assessed by cognitive bias, behavioural and physiological parameters?","Annalisa Scollo, Flaviana Gottardo, Barbara Contiero, Sandra A Edwards",-,-,,62,2014,Scollo2014.pdf,no,"  - ""All experimental procedures and animal care were carried out in accordance with the minimum standards for the protection of pigs laid down by law (Council of The European Union, 2008), and were approved by the Ethical Review Committee of Newcastle University.""",,"- The paper mentions that the experimental procedures were approved by the Ethical Review Committee of Newcastle University, which suggests that there was some form of protocol or plan in place that was reviewed and approved.
- However, there is no explicit mention of whether the study was registered, pre-registered, or based on a pre-defined protocol or study plan.
- The approval by an ethical review committee is a common practice for ensuring that research meets ethical standards, but it does not necessarily imply registration or pre-registration of the study protocol."
Effect of gender and halothane genotype on cognitive bias and its relationship with fear in pigs,"Ricard Carreras, Laura Arroyo, Eva Mainau, Raquel Pe Ña, Anna Bassols, Antoni Dalmau, Luigi Faucitano, Xavier Manteca, Antonio Velarde",-,-,,17,2016,Carreras2016.pdf,no,"  - ""The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of IRTA.""",,"- The paper mentions that the study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of IRTA, which indicates that there was some form of protocol or plan in place that was reviewed and approved by an ethics committee.
- However, there is no explicit mention of whether the study was registered, pre-registered, or based on a pre-defined protocol or study plan.
- The approval by an ethics committee suggests some level of protocol or plan, but it does not specify whether it was registered or pre-registered."
"Effects of Cage Enrichment on Behavior, Welfare and Outcome Variability in Female Mice","Jeremy D Bailoo, Eimear Murphy, Maria Boada-Saña, Justin A Varholick, Sara Hintze, Caroline Baussière, Kerstin C Hahn, Christine Göpfert, Rupert Palme, Bernhard Voelkl, Hanno Würbel",-,-,Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience,85,2018,Bailoo_2018.pdf,no,"  - """"The study was carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the Swiss Animal Welfare Ordinance (TSchV 455.1). It was approved by the Cantonal Veterinary Office in Bern, Switzerland (permit number: BE16/16).""""",,"- The paper mentions that the study was conducted in accordance with specific guidelines and was approved by a veterinary office, which suggests that there was some form of protocol or plan in place.
- However, there is no explicit mention of the study being registered, pre-registered, or based on a pre-defined protocol or study plan.
- The approval by the Cantonal Veterinary Office indicates that there was some form of oversight and adherence to regulations, but this does not necessarily imply a registered protocol in the context of clinical trial registration or pre-registration."
Frontal brain deactivation during a non-verbal cognitive judgement bias test in sheep,"Kathrin Guldimann, Sabine Vögeli, Martin Wolf, Beat Wechsler, Lorenz Gygax",-,-,Brain and Cognition,20,2015,Guldimann2015.pdf,no,"  - ""R version 3.1.0 (R Core Team, 2014) was used for all statistical analyses. Model selection was performed by using model probabilities (weights) based on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC; Gygax et al., 2013) using an all-subset strategy in modelling the go/no-go response (function dredge in package MuMIn; Barton, 2014) and a specific set of models in evaluating the fNIRS reaction (modified function aictab in package AICcmodavg; Mazerolle, 2013).""
  - ""The minimum model in the analysed set was the null model, and the maximum model contained the fixed effects housing condition (level with two factors: unpredictable, stimulus-poor; predictable, stimulus-rich), position of the box (continuous relative position), whether or not a go response followed the visual assessment (factor with two levels: no-go and go reaction), the time course throughout the stimulation (a spline based on time coded as a continuous variable), location of the measurement paths on the head (lateral position: indicator for left versus right hemisphere; longitudinal position: indicator for cranial versus caudal location; measurement depth: deep versus superficial measurement) and all their possible interactions.""
  - ""The complete set of models analysed therefore included 24 models.""
  - ""This project was assessed by the Swiss National Science Foundation, and all procedures have been approved by the Cantonal authority (Canton of Thurgau, permits nos. F6/10 and F4/11 for conducting animal experiments).""",,"- The paper mentions that the project was assessed and approved by the Swiss National Science Foundation and the Cantonal authority, which suggests that there was some form of protocol or study plan in place.
- The detailed description of the experimental design, including the use of specific statistical models and software, indicates a structured approach to the study.
- The mention of model selection and analysis using specific statistical techniques suggests that there was a pre-defined protocol for data analysis.
- However, there is no explicit mention of whether the study was registered or pre-registered, nor is there any indication of a specific registered protocol number or link to a registration database."
"Measurement of cognitive bias and cortisol levels to evaluate the effects of space restriction on captive collared peccary (Mammalia, Tayassuidae)","Flávia R M Oliveira, Sérgio L G Nogueira-Filho, Maria B C Sousa, Carlos T S Dias, Michael Mendl, Selene S C Nogueira",-,-,,11,2016,Oliveira2016.pdf,yes,"  - ""This work followed the ""Principles of laboratory animal care"" (NIH publication No.86-23, revised 1985) and was approved by the Committee of Ethics for Animal Use (CEUA) at the Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruz (protocol #021/13).""",,"- The paper mentions that the study was approved by the Committee of Ethics for Animal Use (CEUA) at the Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruz with a protocol number (#021/13). This indicates that the study was based on a pre-defined protocol or study plan, as it was approved by an ethics committee.
- The mention of a protocol number suggests that the study was registered or had a registered protocol, as ethics committees typically require a detailed protocol for approval.
- The paper does not explicitly state whether the study was pre-registered or not, but the presence of a protocol number and ethics committee approval implies that there was a registered protocol."
