- The treatments started when the pigs were 19 weeks old and lasted until they were 27 weeks old.
- The age range of the pigs during the experiment was from 9 to 27 weeks.
- Pigs typically reach sexual maturity around 24-28 weeks of age, depending on breed and sex.
- Since the pigs were used in the experiment from 9 to 27 weeks of age, they were not sexually mature or close to sexual maturity at the start of the experiment and were still considered juvenile."
"Does stocking density modify affective state in pigs as assessed by cognitive bias, behavioural and physiological parameters?","Annalisa Scollo, Flaviana Gottardo, Barbara Contiero, Sandra A Edwards",-,-,,62,2014,Scollo2014.pdf,juvenile,"  - ""A total of 40 entire male and female crossbred pigs (Large White × Landrace), which had previously experienced the same housing and management conditions, were selected at approximately 14 weeks of age and 45 kg live weight.""",,"- The paper specifies that the pigs were selected at approximately 14 weeks of age. This age is typically considered juvenile, as pigs are not sexually mature at this stage.
- The weight of the pigs is also mentioned as 45 kg, which is consistent with the age provided, further supporting the classification as juvenile.
- There is no mention of any pigs being sexually mature or close to sexual maturity, which would be indicative of adult status."
Effect of gender and halothane genotype on cognitive bias and its relationship with fear in pigs,"Ricard Carreras, Laura Arroyo, Eva Mainau, Raquel Pe Ña, Anna Bassols, Antoni Dalmau, Luigi Faucitano, Xavier Manteca, Antonio Velarde",-,-,,17,2016,Carreras2016.pdf,juvenile,"  - ""Two days after the NOT pigs were fasted for 8 h, transported to the experimental slaughterhouse of IRTA (1.2 km trip), stunned by exposure to 90% CO 2 at atmospheric air for 3 min and exsanguinated.""
  - ""At 19 weeks of age, pigs were trained and tested individually for the CB according to the methodology described by Carreras et al. (2015).""
  - ""At 9 weeks of age, pigs were transported from a commercial farm to the experimental facilities of IRTA (Monells, Spain) and housed separately by gender and genotype in 8 pens (6 pigs per pen).""
  - ""A total of 48 pigs, in terms of 12Hal-free gilts (NNG), 12Hal carrier gilts (NnG), and 12Hal-free entire males (NNEM) and 12Hal carrier entire males (NnEM) were put on the CBT at the age of 20 weeks and on the NOT four days later.""",,"- The paper explicitly states that the pigs were put on the cognitive bias test (CBT) at the age of 20 weeks.
- The training for the CBT began at 19 weeks of age, indicating that the pigs were still in their juvenile stage.
- The pigs were transported to the experimental facilities at 9 weeks of age, which further supports that they were not yet sexually mature.
- The age of 20 weeks is typically considered juvenile for pigs, as they are not yet sexually mature or close to sexual maturity."
"Effects of Cage Enrichment on Behavior, Welfare and Outcome Variability in Female Mice","Jeremy D Bailoo, Eimear Murphy, Maria Boada-Saña, Justin A Varholick, Sara Hintze, Caroline Baussière, Kerstin C Hahn, Christine Göpfert, Rupert Palme, Bernhard Voelkl, Hanno Würbel",-,-,Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience,85,2018,Bailoo_2018.pdf,juvenile,"  - ""All mice were ear-tattooed for identification by the same two experimenters (JB and EM) on the day following arrival at the laboratory.""
  - ""Each batch was comprised of 48 newly weaned non-sibling mice (21-25 days old at delivery) per strain.""",,"- The paper specifies that the mice were ""newly weaned non-sibling mice (21-25 days old at delivery)."" This indicates that the mice were very young, as weaning typically occurs around 21-28 days of age in mice.
- The age range of 21-25 days old at delivery suggests that the mice were not yet sexually mature, as sexual maturity in mice typically occurs around 6-8 weeks of age.
- The description of the mice as ""newly weaned"" further supports the classification of their age as juvenile, as they were not yet close to becoming sexually mature."
Frontal brain deactivation during a non-verbal cognitive judgement bias test in sheep,"Kathrin Guldimann, Sabine Vögeli, Martin Wolf, Beat Wechsler, Lorenz Gygax",-,-,Brain and Cognition,20,2015,Guldimann2015.pdf,adult,"  - ""Twenty-nine female non-lactating and non-gestating Lacaune sheep about 2.5 years of age made up the two groups used in this experiment (Vögeli et al., 2014).""",,"- The paper explicitly states that the sheep used in the experiment were ""about 2.5 years of age.""
- This age is typically considered young adult or close to sexual maturity for sheep, as they usually reach sexual maturity around 1-2 years of age.
- Therefore, the age category for the animals used in this experiment is ""adult,"" as they were sexually mature or close to sexual maturity."
"Measurement of cognitive bias and cortisol levels to evaluate the effects of space restriction on captive collared peccary (Mammalia, Tayassuidae)","Flávia R M Oliveira, Sérgio L G Nogueira-Filho, Maria B C Sousa, Carlos T S Dias, Michael Mendl, Selene S C Nogueira",-,-,,11,2016,Oliveira2016.pdf,adult,"  - ""We carried out an experiment with six adult male collared peccaries (Pecari tajacu) at the Laboratório de Etologia Aplicada, Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruz, Brazil (14 • 47 39.8 S, 39 • 10 27.7 W).""
  - ""The experimental animals, aged between 4 and 6 years old and weighing 23.0 ± 2.2 kg, were from the same herd (N = 23), born and raised in captive conditions.""",,"- The paper explicitly states that the animals used in the experiment were ""adult male collared peccaries,"" which indicates that they were sexually mature or close to sexual maturity.
- Additionally, the age range of the animals is provided as ""aged between 4 and 6 years old,"" which further supports the classification as adult since they are beyond the juvenile stage.
- The combination of being described as ""adult"" and having an age range that is typically considered mature for the species confirms that the animals were not juvenile."
The effects of housing conditions on judgement bias in Japanese quail,"Mária Horváth, Katarína Pichová, L ' Ubor Košt'ál",-,-,,12,2016,Horvàth2016.pdf,-,"  - ""Female Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) were hatched and reared at the Institute of Animal Biochemistry and Genetics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Ivanka pri Dunaji, Slovak Republic.""
  - ""The animals were fed on resticted rations equivalent to 80% of the average daily ad libitum food intake at the corresponding age (according to Baumgartner, 1990).""
  - ""The quails were group housed in wire cages with floor space 5620 cm 2 (maximum 12 birds per cage).""
  - ""The deep litter pen had floor space 7870 cm 2 . Its floor was covered with wood shavings, and the birds were provided with nipple drinkers and feeders.""
  - ""The birds were group housed in groups of 3 to 10.""
  - ""The significant differences in the proportion of responses to positive and negative cue were observed very soon (session 1-3) and the quails reached the discrimination criterion (successive discrimination on 3 consecutive days) in 7-9 sessions.""",,"- The paper does not explicitly mention the age of the quails used in the experiment.
- The mention of ""hatched and reared"" suggests that the quails were raised from a young age, but it does not specify whether they were juvenile or adult at the time of the experiment.
- The feeding ration is adjusted according to age, but this does not provide specific information about the age of the quails during the experiment.
- The training and experimental procedures suggest that the quails were capable of learning and responding to stimuli, which could indicate they were not very young, but again, no specific age is mentioned.
- The lack of explicit age information means we cannot definitively categorize the quails as juvenile or adult based on the provided text."
Validation of a novel cognitive bias task based on difference in quantity of reinforcement for assessing environmental enrichment,"Heidi A Keen, O Lynne Nelson, Charles T Robbins, Marc Evans, David J Shepherdson, Ruth C Newberry",-,-,-,-,-,Keen2014.pdf,adult,"  - ""Eight adult grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) from the Washington State University Bear Research, Education, and Conservation Center participated in this study.""
  - ""The untrained females (Cooke and Oakley) were brought to the facility as adults after removal from the wild. They had been at the facility for 2 years, and their ages were both estimated at 6-7 years.""
  - ""The males (Frank and John) were brought to the facility as juveniles and had been there for 9 years.""
  - ""The two pairs of extensively trained females (Kio and Peeka; Luna and Mica) were 5 and 7 years of age, respectively, and were hand-reared at the facility.""",,"- The paper explicitly states that the study involved ""eight adult grizzly bears,"" indicating that all the animals used in the experiment were adults.
- The ages of some of the bears are provided, with the females being 5 and 7 years old, and the untrained females estimated to be 6-7 years old. These ages confirm that the bears were sexually mature or close to sexual maturity.
- The males were brought to the facility as juveniles but had been there for 9 years, suggesting they were also adults by the time of the study.
- The paper does not mention any bears that were not sexually mature or close to becoming sexually mature, which would be indicative of a juvenile status."
