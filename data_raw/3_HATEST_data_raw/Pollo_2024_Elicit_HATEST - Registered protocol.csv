  - ""We also used the ""trim and fill"" method of Duvall and Tweedie (2000) to estimate the number of ""missing"" studies based on a funnel plot of the data (i.e. effect size vs sample size) and then calculated the mean effect if these hypothetical ""missing"" studies are included.""",,"- The paper describes a meta-analysis using data from 29 studies of 25 species, indicating that the study is a review of existing literature rather than a new experimental study.
