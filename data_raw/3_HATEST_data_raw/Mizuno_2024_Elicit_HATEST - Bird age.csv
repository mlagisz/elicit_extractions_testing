Body size affects the evolution of eyespots in caterpillars,"Thomas John Hossie, John Skelhorn, Jesse W Breinholt, Akito Y Kawahara, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,50,2015,Hossie_2015.pdf,chick,"  - ""Seventy-two female domestic chicks of the Novogen Brown strain (Gallus gallus domesticus) were purchased from a commercial hatchery on the day of hatching.""
  - ""During training and testing, two ""buddy"" chicks were placed in a ""buddy arena"" adjacent to the experimental arena to prevent experimental chicks being visually isolated from conspecifics.""
  - ""Laboratory Presentations. Artificial caterpillars arranged in a 2 × 3 factorial design (small, large body size × no eyespots, small eyespots, large eyespots) were presented singly to domestic chicks, which were monitored until the prey item was attacked.""
  - ""On day 3, experimental birds were randomly assigned to one of six groups (n = 10 per group). Birds in all groups received a single test trial, in which they were placed in the experimental arena individually after 30 min of food deprivation (SI Materials and Methods).""",,"- The paper mentions the use of ""domestic chicks"" in the laboratory experiments, which are typically young birds.
- The chicks were purchased from a commercial hatchery on the day of hatching, indicating they were very young at the start of the experiment.
- The experiments were conducted on day 3 after hatching, which further supports that the birds were chicks rather than adults or nestlings.
- There is no mention of the birds being adults or nestlings, and the context suggests they were young chicks."
Deflective effect and the effect of prey detectability on anti-predator function of eyespots,"Adrian Vallin, Marina Dimitrova, Ullasa Kodandaramaiah, Sami Merilaita, D Kemp",-,-,Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology,38,2011,Vallin_2011.pdf,adult,"  - ""The birds were ringed and released at the site of their capture after use in the present study. All the birds maintained their condition and were healthy upon release.""
  - ""Before the present study, the birds were first used in another experiment. In that experiment, they all were treated alike and had searched for cryptic, rectangular prey items.""
  - ""We caught blue tits at the research station using mist nets and housed them indoors in individual cages (80×60×40 cm).""
  - ""We used wild caught blue tits, C. caeruleus, as predators, because they are insectivorous passerines and have been successfully used in previous predation experiments on butterflies and eyespots (e.g., Vallin et al. 2006Vallin et al. , 2007)).""",,"- The paper mentions that the birds used in the study were ""wild caught blue tits,"" which suggests they were adult birds since they were caught in the wild and used in experiments.
- The description of the birds being caught using mist nets and housed in individual cages implies they were likely adult birds capable of being caught and handled in such a manner.
- The mention of the birds being used in another experiment before this one and being ringed and released after the study suggests they were mature enough to be handled and reused in experiments, which is consistent with adult birds.
- There is no mention of the birds being chicks or nestlings, which would typically require different handling and care procedures."
Eyespots interact with body colour to protect caterpillar-like prey from avian predators,"Thomas John Hossie, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,Animal Behaviour,37,2012,Hossie_2012.pdf,NA,"  - ""Insectivorous bird species observed in each of the field locations are detailed in Supplementary Table S2""
  - ""Pastry caterpillars were designed to be fully palatable to birds, and our experimental design was approved by the Carleton University Research Ethics Committee (Protocol B10-14).""
  - ""Our experiment examined the protective value of eyespots and countershading in caterpillar-like prey subject to predation by wild avian predators.""
  - ""The total 90 h mortality rate for a location ranged from 32% to 91% (mean AE SE: 68 AE 6.32%).""
  - ""Overall, a similar proportion of caterpillars disappeared upon attack in all four treatments (mean proportion AE SE ¼ 0.50 AE 0.05; F 3,24 ¼ 1.27, P ¼ 0.31).""
  - ""There was no significant effect of treatment on the number of pecks received by attacked pastry caterpillars recovered from the field (F 3,307 ¼ 1.12, P ¼ 0.295, overall mean -AE SE ¼ 3.78 AE 0.18).""
  - ""Pecks were not evenly allocated along all sections of the pastry caterpillars (c 2 5 ¼ 459.34, P < 0.001), and the distribution of pecks was affected by the presence of eyespots (c 2 6 ¼ 49.858, P < 0.001), but not by countershading (c 2 6 ¼ 9.904, P ¼ 0.13).""
  - ""Eyespots also affected the area of the pastry caterpillar's body that was pecked by birds, which may represent an additional advantage to the caterpillars.""",,"- The paper discusses experiments involving avian predators and artificial caterpillars with eyespots and countershading.
- The paper mentions that the experimental design was approved by the Carleton University Research Ethics Committee, indicating that the study involved wild birds.
- The paper provides details about the species of birds observed in the field locations but does not specify the age of the birds.
- The focus of the study is on the protective value of eyespots and countershading against avian predation, not on the age of the birds.
- There is no mention of the age of the birds in the text or in the tables referenced."
Field experiments on the effectiveness of 'eyespots' as predator deterrents,"Martin Stevens, Elinor Hopkins, William Hinde, Amabel Adcock, Yvonne Connolly, Tom Troscianko, Innes C Cuthill, K T Troscianko",-,-,-,-,-,Stevens_2007.pdf,NA,"  - ""the blue tit Parus caeruleus (Hart et al. 2000), and for different daylight illuminants (cloudy and blue sky), to assess the robustness of our estimates.""
  - ""The starling was chosen as a typical passerine for which there are good data on double cone spectral sensitivity (Hart et al. 1998).""
  - ""The main avian predators in the area were blue tits, great tits, Parus major, European robins, Erithacus rubecula, Chaffinches, Fringilla coelebs, and house sparrows, Passer domesticus.""",,"- The paper mentions several bird species involved in the experiments, such as blue tits, great tits, European robins, Chaffinches, and house sparrows. However, it does not specify the age of these birds.
- The mention of the starling and blue tit is in the context of their visual sensitivity and not their age.
- There is no mention of the age of the birds used in the experiments, such as whether they were adults, chicks, or nestlings."
Significance of butterfly eyespots as an anti-predator device in ground-based and aerial attacks,"Anne Lyytinen, Paul M Brakefield, Johanna Mappes",-,-,,93,2003,Lyytinen_2003.pdf,NA,"  - ""Pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) are small passerine birds that feed on insects and other arthropods catching them in the air, from foliage, or from the ground.""
  - ""We trapped the birds in Konnevesi, Central Finland and put them into illuminated cages (65 × 80× 65 cm) where they were maintained on the diet of mealworms and water ad libitum.""
  - ""The experiment was conducted in June 2001 at the Konnevesi Research Station. After the experiments, we released all birds.""
  - ""Pied flycatchers (n =21) attacked equally often the wings in both butterfly forms (8 and 8, respectively; with in five cases the bird blocking the view of the observer, Table 2""
  - ""Pied flycatchers catch insects in the air but prefer to snatch them from the ground or vegetation (Lundberg and Alatalo 1992).""
  - ""Both model predators are insectivorous but not specialised to catch butterflies.""
  - ""The experiment was video recorded to analyse the target of the attack.""",,"- The paper describes the use of pied flycatchers as model predators in experiments related to butterfly eyespots.
- The birds were trapped in Central Finland and used in experiments at the Konnevesi Research Station.
- The paper does not specify the age of the birds used in the experiments.
- The focus is on the behavior of the birds in relation to butterfly eyespots, not on their developmental stage or age."
The Feeding Behaviour of Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) in the Presence of 'Eyes',"I R Inglis, L W Huson, M B Marshall, P A Arid,  Neville",-,-,-,-,-,Inglis_1983.pdf,adult,"  - ""The subjects were eight adult starlings randomly selected from the stock of wild caught birds.""
  - ""The subjects were eight adult starlings randomly selected from the pool of wild caught birds.""
  - ""The subjects were eight adult starlings randomly selected from the central pool of wild caught birds.""",,"- The paper repeatedly mentions that the subjects used in the experiments were ""adult starlings."" This indicates that the age of the birds used in the study was consistently adult.
- There is no mention of any other age groups such as chicks or nestlings being used in the experiments.
- The focus of the study was on adult starlings, and all experiments involved these birds."
The position of eyespots and thickened segments influence their protective value to caterpillars,"John Skelhorn, Giles Dorrington, Thomas J Hossie, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,,16,2014,Skelhorn_2014.pdf,chick,"  - ""On Day 1 posthatch, chicks were left to acclimatize to the laboratory for 1 h before being individually color marked (see previously).""
  - ""Fifty-nine newly hatched domestic chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus) of the ""Ross"" strain were purchased from a commercial hatchery in Berwickshire, UK.""
  - ""On Day 2, 51 experimental chicks were trained to eat chick starter crumbs from the white paper-covered floor of an experimental arena.""
  - ""On Day 4, the 24 birds that were to be the subjects of Experiment 2 were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 experimental groups (n = 8 per group).""
  - ""On Day 4, the 27 birds that were to be the subjects of Experiment 1 were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 experimental groups (n = 9 per group).""",,"- The paper specifies that the subjects used in the experiments were ""newly hatched domestic chicks,"" which indicates that they were very young birds.
- The experiments were conducted on Day 4 posthatch, which further confirms that the birds were chicks at the time of the experiments.
- The term ""chick"" is used consistently throughout the paper to refer to the birds used in the experiments."
"The protective value of conspicuous signals is not impaired by shape, size, or position asymmetry","Martin Stevens, Sarah A Castor-Perry, Jessica R F Price",-,-,,19,2009,Stevens&CastorPerry_2009.pdf,NA,"  - ""avian predation was revealed by the disappearance of all or most of the mealworm from the target.""
  - ""The woodland has a range of avian predators, primarily small songbirds (see Stevens, Hardman, and Stubbins 2008)""
  - ""We undertook 2 field experiments with artificial gray-scale prey, marked with a pair of white markings presented to wild avian predators, to test the effect of asymmetry on the survival value of conspicuous signals in the field.""",,"- The paper discusses experiments conducted in a natural setting with artificial prey presented to wild avian predators.
- The predators are described as ""wild avian predators"" and ""small songbirds,"" but there is no specific mention of the age of these birds.
- The focus of the study is on the effect of asymmetry in warning signals on predator avoidance, not on the age of the predators.
- Since the paper does not specify the age of the birds involved in the experiments, the answer must be ""NA"" (Not Applicable)."
