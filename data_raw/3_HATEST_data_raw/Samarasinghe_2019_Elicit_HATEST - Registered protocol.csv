Built environmental correlates of older adults' total physical activity and walking: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"David W Barnett, Anthony Barnett, Andrea Nathan, Jelle Van Cauwenberg, Ester Cerin",-,-,-,-,-,Barnett_2017.pdf,yes,"  - ""This systematic review and meta-analysis was registered in PROSPERO (Registration no. CRD42016051227 [38]) in November 2016.""",,"- The paper explicitly states that the systematic review and meta-analysis were registered in PROSPERO, which is a database of prospectively registered systematic reviews.
- The registration number (CRD42016051227) is provided, indicating that the study was formally registered before its conduct.
- The registration date is specified as November 2016, which suggests that the protocol was pre-registered before the review was conducted."
Economic analysis of the health impacts of housing improvement studies: a systematic review,"Elisabeth Fenwick, Catriona Macdonald, Hilary Thomson",-,-,Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health,35,2013,Fenwick_2013.pdf,no,"  - ""The reported data were assessed for their suitability to economic evaluation.""
  - ""The study designs varied and included five randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and 23 non-randomised controlled studies.""
  - ""The cost data were tabulated alongside a summary of reported heath impacts and an indication of overall study quality as used in the original review (A=minimal bias, B=some bias, C=considerable bias).""
  - ""Studies were allocated into two groups based on the type of data reported.""
  - ""Forty-five studies were identified in the original review.""
  - ""The health outcomes reported included validated measures, for example SF-36, and selfreported measures, and covered four main domains: general health; mental health; respiratory health; and other/illness and symptoms.""",,"- The paper discusses the systematic review of housing improvement studies, but there is no mention of a registered protocol or pre-registration for the review itself.
- The paper describes the methodology used for the systematic review, including the extraction and assessment of data, but does not indicate that this process was based on a pre-defined or registered protocol.
- The mention of study quality and allocation into groups suggests a structured approach, but this does not equate to a registered protocol.
- The paper does not explicitly state that the systematic review or any of the included studies were registered or pre-registered."
Impacts of heat waves and corresponding measures: a review,"Jian Zuo, Stephen Pullen, Jasmine Palmer, Helen Bennetts, Nicholas Chileshe, Tony Ma",-,-,,242,2015,Zuo_2015.pdf,no,"  - ""The organization of this paper is as follows. The second chapter provides the methodology employed in this paper to identify and analyse literature related to heat waves.""
  - ""a critical literature review which covers the following main aspects: (1) the definition of heat waves; (2) the impacts of heat waves on health, ecosystems and the built environment;

(3) the current mechanisms to deal with impacts of heat waves.""
  - ""A list of keywords was used to search related papers and reports.""
  - ""The aim of this research is to present a critical review of impacts of heat waves and corresponding mechanisms.""",,"- The paper is described as a ""critical review"" of the impacts of heat waves and mechanisms to mitigate these effects. This suggests that the study is a literature review rather than an empirical study that would require a registered protocol.
- The methodology involves searching for related papers and reports using a list of keywords, which is typical for a literature review.
- The paper does not mention any empirical data collection or experimental design that would necessitate a registered protocol.
- The focus on reviewing existing literature and identifying gaps in knowledge does not require a pre-defined protocol or registration in the same way that original research studies do."

  - ""Following guidance for systematic reviews [21,26], a data extraction method was developed.""
  - ""The search was deliberately broad, to allow all relevant publications indexed in the two databases to be identified.""
  - ""The systematic review presented here builds on a wellestablished methodology originating from the health and social sciences [21][22].""",,"- The paper describes the use of a ""well-established methodology"" and ""clearly defined search criteria,"" which suggests a structured approach to the review.
- The mention of ""guidance for systematic reviews"" indicates adherence to established protocols for conducting systematic reviews.
- The paper does not explicitly mention whether the study was registered or pre-registered, but it implies a structured protocol by following established methodologies.
- The focus on transparency and reproducibility, as indicated by the use of established methodologies, suggests that the study was conducted based on a pre-defined protocol."
Online engagement for sustainable energy projects: A Systematic review and framework for integration,Danielle Barrios-O'neill,-,-,,34,2016,Barrios-ONeill_2016.pdf,no,"  - ""This study was carried out according to a Narrative Synthesis (NS) framework using a process developed originally by Popay et al. (2006) and further refined by Roen et al. (2006), Arai et al. (2007), and Rodgers et al. (2009)""
  - ""The selection of NS for use in this study reflects the need to create thematic coherence among data sets (both qualitative and quantitative), in order to categorise key areas of challenge and relevant solutions, in a largely unexplored, interdisciplinary area.""
  - ""NS consists of three steps designed to ensure optimal transparency and robustness; these are developing a theory of change, developing a preliminary synthesis, exploring relationships within and between studies, and assessing the robustness of the synthesis (Arai et al., 2007).""
  - ""This study's theory of change is that online communication strategies are likely to be useful in engaging consumers, largely through the provision by organisations of social and technological contexts for understanding energy transitions.""
  - ""The following exclusion criteria and exemptions were used, which narrowed this to 70 studies:

1) Publication date a. excluded all papers published before 1990 ; b. excluded all papers related to interactive media and smart grid before 2000.2""
  - ""The 73 selected papers, discussing potential challenges and solutions relevant to the area of engagement with energy sustainability, were compiled and studied for relationships suggesting common themes or categories (see Popay, 2006 , ""thematic analysis"", p. 18).""
  - ""The framework is intended to provide a basis for refinement by future research using complementary methods, including empirical testing (Leamy et al., 2011).""
  - ""A potential limitation of this method is that outcomes will not reflect the complete range of possibilities and risks related to interactive media engagement and sustainability.""",,"- The study uses a Narrative Synthesis (NS) framework, which is a method of systematic review that involves synthesizing findings from multiple studies to identify themes and patterns.
- The study does not mention any specific protocol registration or pre-registration process. Instead, it focuses on the systematic review process and the framework used for analysis.
- The study's methodology is based on a predefined framework (NS) and involves a structured approach to synthesizing literature, but it does not indicate that the study itself was registered or pre-registered.
- The focus on thematic analysis and the development of a theory of change suggests a structured approach, but this does not equate to a registered protocol in the context of clinical trials or experimental studies."
Relationship between the physical environment and different domains of physical activity in European adults: a systematic review,"Veerle Van Holle, Benedicte Deforche, Jelle Van Cauwenberg, Liesbet Goubert, Lea Maes, Nico Van De Weghe, Ilse De Bourdeaudhuij",-,-,BMC Public Health,317,2012,VanHolle_2012.pdf,no,"  - ""A two-stage search was conducted to identify eligible studies published between January 2000 and August 2011.""
  - ""Figure 1 provides an overview of the search protocol, according to the PRISMA statement [23] and specifies the used search terms.""
  - ""Systematic searches were conducted across six electronic databases: Cinahl, Cochrane, PubMed, SportDiscus, TRIS and Web of Science.""",,"- The paper describes a systematic review process that involved conducting searches across multiple databases, which is a common practice in systematic reviews.
- The mention of a ""two-stage search"" and the use of specific databases indicates a structured approach to data collection.
- The reference to ""Figure 1"" and the ""PRISMA statement"" suggests that the review followed a pre-defined protocol, as PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) is a guideline for reporting systematic reviews.
- The use of a pre-defined protocol is implied by the structured search process and adherence to PRISMA guidelines, but there is no explicit mention of registration or pre-registration of the protocol."

  - ""Due to the clinical and methodological heterogeneity of the designs of the fi nal fi ve studies, we found it inappropriate to undertake quantitative meta-analysis.""
  - ""The data was abstracted in two step process independently by the authors using methodology from Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions 4.2.6 and personal data extraction forms.""
  - ""We used a systematic review approach.""
  - ""The aim of this review was to systematically evaluate whether there is conclusive scientifi c evidence for the effectiveness of urban green spaces as a psychological buffer for the negative impact of noise pollution on human health and to promote an evidence-based approach toward this still growing environmental hazard.""",,"- The paper is a systematic review, which typically involves a pre-defined protocol or study plan to ensure consistency and reliability in the review process.
- The authors mention using a systematic review approach and methodology from the Cochrane Handbook, which suggests adherence to a structured protocol.
- The paper does not explicitly mention whether the protocol was registered or pre-registered, but the use of a systematic review approach implies a pre-defined protocol.
- The focus on qualitative assessment due to heterogeneity in study designs further supports the idea that a protocol was followed to guide the review process."
