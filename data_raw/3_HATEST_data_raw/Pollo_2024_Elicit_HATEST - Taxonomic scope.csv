- The tables provide further evidence of the diverse taxonomic scope, listing various taxa and trait categories.
- The study does not focus on a single species or a specific taxon but rather encompasses a wide range of species across different taxonomic groups."
Darwinian sex roles confirmed across the animal kingdom,"Tim Janicke, Ines K Häderer, Marc J Lajeunesse, Nils Anthes",-,-,Science Advances,328,2016,Janicke_2016.pdf,multiple species from all taxa,"  - ""We identified 72 studies on 66 animal species, providing estimates of I, I s , and/or b ss for males and females (Fig. 1""

  - ""We quantitatively contrasted these opposing theories using established metrics of sexual selection: (i) the standardized variance in reproductive success (""opportunity for selection,"" I), (ii) the standardized variance in mating success (""opportunity for sexual selection,"" I s ), and (iii) the slope of an ordinary weighted least-squares regression of reproductive success on mating success (""Bateman gradient,"" b ss""
  - ""Our findings confirm the generality of conventional sex roles in polygamous animals (Fig. 3""
  - ""We performed a meta-analysis to test the generality of Bateman's principles across the animal kingdom and to explore how between-study variation in the three tested Bateman parameters translates into differences in parental care and sexual dimorphism.""",,"- The study involves a meta-analysis of 72 studies covering 66 animal species, indicating that the research is not focused on a single species but rather encompasses multiple species.
- The mention of ""across the animal kingdom"" and ""the generality of conventional sex roles in polygamous animals"" suggests that the study is not limited to a specific taxonomic group but rather covers a broad range of animal species.
- The use of terms like ""animal kingdom"" and ""polygamous animals"" implies that the study is not restricted to a particular taxon but includes multiple species from various taxonomic groups.
- The study's aim to test the generality of Bateman's principles across different species further supports the idea that it is not focused on a single species or a specific taxon."
Measuring and interpreting sexual selection metrics: evaluation and guidelines,"Nils Anthes, Ines K H € Aderer, Nico K Michiels, Tim Janicke",-,-,,42,2017,Anthes_2017.pdf,multiple species from all taxa,"  - ""Our review illustrates this variation, using the Bateman gradient, a particularly prominent sexual selection metric.""

- The authors mention that their methodological arguments extend to all other recently advocated metrics of sexual selection, indicating a broad scope.
- The paper does not focus on a single species or a specific taxonomic group but rather discusses general principles and methodologies applicable across different species.
- The mention of data deposited in the Dryad repository suggests that the study is based on a meta-analysis, which typically involves data from multiple studies across different species.

Mechanisms of Social Influence: A Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Social Information on Female Mate Choice Decisions,"Blake Carlton Jones, Emily H Duval",-,-,Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution,35,2019,Jones_2019.pdf,multiple species from all taxa,"  - ""We evaluated effect sizes across 103 experiments from 40 studies that experimentally measured female mate-choice copying in non-human animals representing Arachnida, Insecta, Malacostraca, Aves, and Actinoperygii.""
  - ""Our analysis included experiments on 17 species from 13 different families, representing three classes of arthropods and two classes of vertebrates.""
  - ""The phylogenetic signal of the strength of mate-choice copying was virtually non-existent, indicating that this behavior is taxonomically widespread.""
  - ""We suggest that mate-choice copying is not an isolated and discreetly evolved trait within social animals, but rather one of many manifestations of an underlying evolved cognitive ability to observe and copy the choices of others.""
  - ""The results of this meta-analysis suggest several areas for future work. First, as noted above, it would be interesting to expand the meta-analysis framework to studies that measured mate-choice copying in different ways.""
  - ""The reported differences between levels of the explanatory factors are likely underestimated, specifically for male attractiveness and observer experience, as one of the two compared levels for each factor included unavoidable uncertainty.""",,"- The study evaluates mate-choice copying across a wide range of species, as indicated by the mention of 17 species from 13 different families and five classes (Arachnida, Insecta, Malacostraca, Aves, and Actinoperygii). This suggests a broad taxonomic scope.
- The paper explicitly states that the behavior of mate-choice copying is ""taxonomically widespread,"" which implies that the study is not limited to a specific taxonomic group.
- The inclusion of multiple classes of both arthropods and vertebrates further supports the idea that the study encompasses multiple species from all taxa rather than focusing on a single species or a specific taxonomic group.
- The study's aim to assess the magnitude of mate-choice copying effects across various species and its mention of the behavior being widespread across taxa indicate a broad taxonomic scope."

The relative importance of size and asymmetry in sexual selection,"R Thornhid', A P M0ller, A P Moller",-,-,,88,1998,Thornhill_1998.pdf,multiple species from all taxa,"  - ""Studies that allowed comparison of the relationships for the same traits' size and symmetry and success in sexual competition constituted the data, which totaled 73 samples from 33 studies of 29 species.""
  - ""The data set used for the present study is from Mailer and Thornhill (1998), which was based on (1) a comprehensive search of the literature and of the Internet for information on the relationship between asymmetry and sexual selection, and (2) correspondence between the authors and behavioral ecologists conducting research on this relationship.""
  - ""Recently, Mailer and Thornhill (1998), in a meta-analysis of sexual selection in relation to asymmetry in 146 samples from 65 studies of 42 species of all known studies (insects, fish, birds and mammals), found a moderately negative, statistically significant relationship between asymmetry and mating success or attractiveness to the opposite sex""
  - ""The aim of the present study was to test whether the magnitude of the effect of asymmetry on sexual selection was similar to that of character size per se, which is known from numerous studies to be related to sexual selection (see review in Andersson, 1994).""
  - ""The general role of asymmetry in sexual selection has been disputed because several studies have shown no effects, whereas others have demonstrated highly significant effects.""
  - ""In conclusion, the relative importance of character size and symmetry was evaluated meta-anah/tically for all available studies, and the calculations demonstrated significant relationships for both size and symmetry, but symmetry appears to have a slightly greater effect, especially in studies of secondary sexual traits.""","  - ""<table_quotation page_num=3 table_on_page=1></table_quotation>""

- The study aims to evaluate the relative importance of size and symmetry across different species, which implies a focus on multiple species rather than a single species or a specific taxon.

Variation in pre-and post-copulatory sexual selection on male genital size in two species of lygaeid bug,"Liam R Dougherty, David M Shuker",-,-,Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology,18,2016,Dougherty_2016.pdf,multiple species from a specific taxon,"  - ""Lygaeus equestris L. and L. simulans Deckert are two closely related species of lygaeid bug (Heteroptera: Lygaeiodea; Lygaeinae).""
  - ""In this study, we measure selection acting on the length of the intromittent organ in the seed bug Lygaeus equestris and its sister species L. simulans.""
  - ""We measured the strength and pattern of selection acting on the length of the male intromittent organ (or processus) in two closely related species of lygaeid seed bug: Lygaeus equestris and Lygaeus simulans.""",,"- The study focuses on two specific species, Lygaeus equestris and Lygaeus simulans, which are closely related and belong to the same taxonomic group (lygaeid seed bugs).
- The paper explicitly mentions that the study is conducted on these two species, indicating a focus on a specific taxonomic group rather than a single species or all possible organisms.
- The taxonomic scope is therefore ""multiple species from a specific taxon"" because the study is focused on two species within the lygaeid bug taxon."
