Behavioral effects of triadimefon in zebrafish are associated with alterations of the dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways,"Susana Paredes-Zúñiga, Nils Trost, Javiera F De La Paz, Julio Alcayaga, Miguel L Allende",-,-,Progress in Neuro-psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry,29,2019,zuniga_2019.pdf,10 hours,"  - ""5 dpf larvae were incubated in 96-well multiwell plates with 200 μL of TDF ranging from 5 mg/L to 35 mg/L at room temperature (23-26 °C) for 10 h under constant illumination.""
  - ""5 dpf larvae were immersed in LMP agarose 1% (v/v) (peqGOLD 35-2099; PEQ-LAB Biotechnologie) with 1% of MS-222 (tricaine; A5040; Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA). Electrochemistry was performed using an extracellular solution containing (in mM): 134 NaCl, 2.9 KCl, 2.1 CaCl 2 , 1.2 MgCl 2 , 10 HEPES, and 10 glucose (Sigma-Aldrich) equilibrated to pH 7.4, according to Shang et al. (2015). Neurotransmitter levels were recorded in the same specimen 1 min before and after being in contact with the drug.""
  - ""To record and analyze the behavior of adult zebrafish treated with TDF 5 mg/L and 20 mg/L we followed the methods described in Cachat et al. (2011). Experimentally naïve zebrafish of both sexes (50% each) and similar size were used. Since gender could affect the behavioral outcome, we previously analyzed our data observing no statistical differences between males and females (data not shown). All animals belonged to the same strain (TAB5) and were raised and manipulated equally. The acclimatization (10 days) and the test were carried out in a trapezoidal tank made of glass (15 height x top 28 × 22 bottom × 7.5 width, cm, Aquamundo, Santiago, Chile) filled with 1.5 L of aquarium water. On the day of the test, zebrafish were relocated into the test tank which was virtually divided in two horizontal halves by drawing a line in the outside wall. TDF was added to the water and zebrafish were in contact with the drug for 5 min before beginning the recordings.""
  - ""5 dpf larvae (n = 30-50) were incubated with TDF 5 mg/L for 15 min.""",,"- The paper describes several experiments with different exposure durations for the pesticide Triadimefon (TDF).
- For larval zebrafish, the longest exposure duration mentioned is 10 hours, as indicated in the first quote.
- The second quote mentions a 15-minute exposure for mRNA expression analysis, but this is not the longest duration.
- The third quote refers to a very short exposure for electrochemistry measurements, which is not relevant to the longest exposure duration.
- The fourth quote mentions a 5-minute exposure for adult zebrafish, which is shorter than the 10-hour exposure for larvae.
- Therefore, the longest exposure duration used in the behavioral experiment is 10 hours."
