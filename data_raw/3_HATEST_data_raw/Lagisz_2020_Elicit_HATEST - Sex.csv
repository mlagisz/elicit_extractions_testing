"Does stocking density modify affective state in pigs as assessed by cognitive bias, behavioural and physiological parameters?","Annalisa Scollo, Flaviana Gottardo, Barbara Contiero, Sandra A Edwards",-,-,,62,2014,Scollo2014.pdf,both,"  - ""Animals were housed in 4 matched pens of 10 pigs each (5 females and 5 males).""
  - ""A total of 40 entire male and female crossbred pigs (Large White × Landrace), which had previously experienced the same housing and management conditions, were selected at approximately 14 weeks of age and 45 kg live weight.""",,"- The paper explicitly states that the study involved ""entire male and female crossbred pigs,"" indicating that both male and female animals were used in the study.
- The housing arrangement is described as ""4 matched pens of 10 pigs each (5 females and 5 males),"" which further confirms that both sexes were included in the study."
Effect of gender and halothane genotype on cognitive bias and its relationship with fear in pigs,"Ricard Carreras, Laura Arroyo, Eva Mainau, Raquel Pe Ña, Anna Bassols, Antoni Dalmau, Luigi Faucitano, Xavier Manteca, Antonio Velarde",-,-,,17,2016,Carreras2016.pdf,both,"  - ""The results of this study showed that pigs' emotional response as assessed using the cognitive bias and the novel object tests is neither affected by the gender nor by the halothane genotype.""
  - ""The lack of difference in the affective state as assessed by the CBT between entire males and gilts found in this study agrees with other previous behavioural studies involving these two genders of pigs (Hessing et al., 1993;van Erp-van der Kooij et al., 2000).""
  - ""The proportion of pigs classified as PosCB, NeuCB and NegCB for each treatment group is shown in Fig. 1 . The proportion of CB classes was not affected by gender (p = 0.278), genotype (p = 0.358) and their interaction (p = 0.560).""
  - ""In this study, 48 crossbred pigs (Landrace × Large White sows sired with Piétrain boars) were divided into four groups of 12 pigs each. Each group either consisted of Hal-free gilts, Hal-free entire males (NNG and NNEM), Hal carrier gilts and Hal carrier entire males (NnG and NnEM).""
  - ""A total of 48 pigs, in terms of 12Hal-free gilts (NNG), 12Hal carrier gilts (NnG), and 12Hal-free entire males (NNEM) and 12Hal carrier entire males (NnEM) were put on the CBT at the age of 20 weeks and on the NOT four days later.""",,"- The paper explicitly mentions the use of both female (gilts) and male (entire males) pigs in the study, as indicated by the division of the 48 pigs into groups based on gender and genotype.
- The study includes both Hal-free and Hal carrier gilts and entire males, indicating that both sexes were used in the experiment.
- The paper discusses the lack of effect of gender on the cognitive bias test results, further confirming that both male and female pigs were part of the study.
- The mention of ""entire males and gilts"" in the context of the study groups and the discussion of gender effects supports the conclusion that both sexes were used."
"Effects of Cage Enrichment on Behavior, Welfare and Outcome Variability in Female Mice","Jeremy D Bailoo, Eimear Murphy, Maria Boada-Saña, Justin A Varholick, Sara Hintze, Caroline Baussière, Kerstin C Hahn, Christine Göpfert, Rupert Palme, Bernhard Voelkl, Hanno Würbel",-,-,Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience,85,2018,Bailoo_2018.pdf,female,"  - ""Subjects were 192 female mice, 96 each of the inbred strain C57BL/6JRj (C57) and the outbred strain RjOrl:SWISS (SWISS) from Janvier Labs, France.""
  - ""Here, using 96 C57BL/6 and SWISS female mice, respectively, we systematically varied environmental enrichment across four levels spanning the range of common enrichment strategies:""
  - ""The aim of the present study was to replicate and extend the results of previous studies on the effects of cage enrichment on mouse behavior and measures of welfare. We varied cage enrichment across four levels, including cages: (i) without any enrichment (Barren, B); (ii) with nesting material (Nesting, N); (iii) with deep bedding, shelters and additional vertical space besides nesting material (Enriched, E); and (iv) large pet cages attached to a laboratory cage, offering multiple resources and different items each week for active engagement (Super-Enriched, SE). To increase the generality of our findings, we studied an inbred and an outbred strain of mouse. However, similar to other proof-of-concept studies on environmental enrichment in mice (Van Loo et al., 2003;Wolfer et al., 2004), we only studied female mice as some forms of enrichment are associated with escalating aggression in male mice.""",,"- The paper explicitly states that the study used ""96 C57BL/6 and SWISS female mice,"" indicating that only female mice were used in the study.
- The aim of the study was to assess the effects of cage enrichment on behavior and welfare in female laboratory mice, further confirming that only female mice were used.
- The study design involved using only female mice to avoid issues with aggression that can arise in male mice with certain enrichment strategies.
- The total number of subjects was 192 female mice, divided into two strains, reinforcing that the study was conducted with female animals only."
Frontal brain deactivation during a non-verbal cognitive judgement bias test in sheep,"Kathrin Guldimann, Sabine Vögeli, Martin Wolf, Beat Wechsler, Lorenz Gygax",-,-,Brain and Cognition,20,2015,Guldimann2015.pdf,female,"  - ""Twenty-nine female non-lactating and non-gestating Lacaune sheep about 2.5 years of age made up the two groups used in this experiment (Vögeli et al., 2014).""
  - ""24 focal sheep (12 from each housing group) that had previously been chosen at random were included in the cognitive judgement bias test.""",,"- The paper explicitly states that the experiment involved ""29 female non-lactating and non-gestating Lacaune sheep,"" which indicates that only female animals were used in the study.
- The mention of ""24 focal sheep"" being included in the cognitive judgement bias test does not specify sex, but since the overall group consisted of only female sheep, it is reasonable to infer that these focal sheep were also female.
- There is no mention of male animals being part of the study, which further supports the conclusion that only female animals were used."
"Measurement of cognitive bias and cortisol levels to evaluate the effects of space restriction on captive collared peccary (Mammalia, Tayassuidae)","Flávia R M Oliveira, Sérgio L G Nogueira-Filho, Maria B C Sousa, Carlos T S Dias, Michael Mendl, Selene S C Nogueira",-,-,,11,2016,Oliveira2016.pdf,male,"  - ""We carried out an experiment with six adult male collared peccaries (Pecari tajacu) at the Laboratório de Etologia Aplicada, Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruz, Brazil (14 • 47 39.8 S, 39 • 10 27.7 W).""
  - ""The experimental animals, aged between 4 and 6 years old and weighing 23.0 ± 2.2 kg, were from the same herd (N = 23), born and raised in captive conditions.""",,"- The paper explicitly states that the experiment was conducted with ""six adult male collared peccaries,"" indicating that only male animals were used in the study.

  - ""The males (Frank and John) were brought to the facility as juveniles and had been there for 9 years.""
  - ""The two pairs of extensively trained females (Kio and Peeka; Luna and Mica) were 5 and 7 years of age, respectively, and were hand-reared at the facility.""
  - ""Eight adult grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) from the Washington State University Bear Research, Education, and Conservation Center participated in this study.""",,"- The paper mentions that the study involved eight adult grizzly bears.
- It specifies that there were two pairs of extensively trained females, indicating that at least four of the bears were female.
- Additionally, it mentions two males, Frank and John, indicating that at least two of the bears were male.
- The presence of both female and male bears in the study is confirmed by these details.
- Therefore, the study used both female and male animals."
