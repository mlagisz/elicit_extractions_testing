  - ""The initial study indicated that while behavioral alterations were certainly present at all stages of life, the nature of those effects were substantially modulated by the stage of development when assessment took place.""
  - ""The second study provided an additional comparison, whereby aged fish with recent vs developmental DZN exposures completed the same tests.""
  - ""Results from the mitochondrial bioenergetics assays showed increased mitochondrial OCR in brain and gonadal tissues of fish in the low and middle dose groups, primarily those that were embryonically exposed to DZN.""
  - ""The present findings provide additional support for the potential neurotoxicity of DZN and other OPs and expand upon the developmental consequences of such exposures.""
  - ""The presence of both behavioral and mitochondrial changes in late adulthood is notable, although there was a disparate dosimetry for those effects, where locomotor and diving effects were usually more prominent as the dose increased while brain tissue respiration was uniquely elevated among lower dose groups.""
  - ""The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.""",,"- The paper discusses various studies and findings related to the effects of diazinon on zebrafish, but it does not mention the sharing of raw data.
- The focus is on the results and interpretations of the studies rather than on data sharing.
- There is no mention of supplementary materials, appendices, or external repositories where raw data might be found.
- The paper does not indicate that raw data is available for download or access through any means."

Further studies showed that TBT exposure inhibited the expressions of genes related to 5-HT (tph2, htr1aa and pet1), DA (th1, slc6a3, drd2a and drd2b) and GABA (gad2 and gabrg2) neurotransmitter systems in the brain.""

  - ""The statistical model was a mixed design analysis of variance with the between subjects factor of developmental exposure and the within subjects factor of repeated trials on the startle test.""
  - ""The swimming activity data were log-transformed for analysis as a standard way to make activity data more normal in distribution to make it more appropriate for the analysis of variance.""

  - ""The limit of quantitation was approximately 1.56 pg/mg tissue. The limit of detection was approximately 1.07 pg/mg tissue.""
  - ""There were external standards run with the analyses.""
  - ""The main effect of trial was analyzed to determine if there was habituation that reduced startle response with repeated trials.""
  - ""The linear trend (slope) of decreasing startle response over the consecutive trials was analyzed to determine exposure effects on habituation.""
  - ""The treatment × trial interactions tested whether the effect of the treatment significantly differed across trials.""

  - ""Repeated measures consisted of the 10 trials of the startle habituation phase.""
