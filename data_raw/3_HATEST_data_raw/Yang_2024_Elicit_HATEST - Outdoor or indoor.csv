Artificial light at night affects brain plasticity and melatonin in birds,"Stan Moaraf, Yulia Vistoropsky, Tatyana Pozner, Rachel Heiblum, Monika Okuliarová, Michal Zeman, Anat Barnea",-,-,Neuroscience Letters,49,2019,Moaraf_2019.pdf,indoor,"  - ""After reaching adulthood (about 90 days), experimental birds (ranging between 3-5 months of age for all groups) were moved from their native colonies to indoor conditions.""
  - ""We used one room for the entire experiment, in which the groups were run at a randomized order within a 5-months period.""
  - ""The experiment consisted of four groups (see below), six birds per group. Zebra finches are very social species. Therefore, birds in each group were kept in one cage (67 × 33 × 33 cm), to avoid isolation stress.""
  - ""Adult female zebra finches were reared outdoor at the Meier Segals Garden for Zoological Research at Tel-Aviv University, Israel.""",,"- The paper mentions that the zebra finches were initially reared outdoors, but the experiment itself was conducted after the birds were moved to indoor conditions.
- The birds were kept in cages indoors for the duration of the experiment, indicating that the study was conducted in a controlled indoor environment.
- The mention of using one room for the entire experiment and keeping the birds in cages further supports that the study was conducted indoors."
Bright light at night alters the perception of daylength in Indian weaver bird (Ploceus philippinus),"Jayant Kumar, Shalie Malik, Sanjay Kumar Bhardwaj, Sangeeta Rani",-,-,Journal of Experimental Zoology Part A Ecological and Integrative Physiology,17,2018,Kumar_2018.pdf,indoor,"  - ""Thereafter, they were transferred to indoor aviary under 8 hr light: 16 hr dark (short photoperiod; 8L:16D).""
  - ""The birds were exposed to short days (8L:16D; L = ∼100 lux, D ≤ 0.1 lux) for ∼3 weeks (19 days) and this served as internal control.""
  - ""Photosensitive birds (n = 33) were individually housed in specially designed activity cages (60 × 35 × 45 cm) that were placed individually in temperature-regulated (24 ± 2 • C) light-proof wooden chambers (75 × 50 × 70 cm) providing programmed light:dark cycles by compact fluorescent lamps (CFL; 14 W, 230 V, Phillips, India).""
  - ""Adult male weaver birds were captured from nature and acclimatized in an outdoor aviary (size = 3 × 2.5 × 2.5 m) under natural photoperiod until beginning of the experiment.""",,"- The birds were initially acclimatized in an outdoor aviary, which suggests an initial outdoor component to the study.
- However, the actual experiments were conducted after the birds were transferred to an indoor aviary, where they were housed in specially designed activity cages within light-proof wooden chambers. This indicates that the experimental phase of the study was conducted indoors.
- The use of controlled light-dark cycles and temperature-regulated chambers further supports that the study was conducted in a controlled indoor environment.
- The mention of ""internal control"" and the specific light-dark conditions suggests a laboratory setting, which is typically indoor."

  - ""On day 22 (23 August) half of the lizards were exposed to 24,100 lux of fluorescent plus incandescent illumination from 2 to 4 p.m. while the other half remained in the dark.""",,"- The paper mentions that the lizards were ""freshly collected"" and then placed in various controlled environments such as ""stockroom conditions,"" ""boxes in the environmental room,"" and ""terraria in one of two 'C' chambers in the Phytotron."" This indicates that the experiments were conducted in controlled laboratory settings.
- The use of controlled light cycles (""LD 12: 12 light cycles"") and specific lighting conditions (""exposed to direct sunlight"" and ""fluorescent plus incandescent illumination"") suggests a controlled indoor environment.
- The mention of ""exposed to direct sunlight"" might suggest an outdoor component, but it is likely that this was done in a controlled setting within the laboratory or a greenhouse-like environment, as indicated by the use of ""terraria"" and ""Phytotron.""
- Overall, the experiments were conducted in controlled indoor settings, with some exposure to natural sunlight as part of the experimental design."
