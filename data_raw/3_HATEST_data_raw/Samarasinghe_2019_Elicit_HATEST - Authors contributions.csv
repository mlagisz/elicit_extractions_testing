Online engagement for sustainable energy projects: A Systematic review and framework for integration,Danielle Barrios-O'neill,-,-,,34,2016,Barrios-ONeill_2016.pdf,yes,"  - ""The main aim of this paper is to address the question, how can the energy sector increase engagement from consumers using online and interactive media communications? Toward this aim a systematic literature review was conducted, consulting discourse and practices from planning, energy and infrastructure, marketing, public engagement and consultation policy, and interactive media engagement.""
  - ""Based on this review, five key challenges to consumer engagement related to online communication and five potential solutions to these challenges were identified (see Table 1""
  - ""The solutions to key challenges form the basis of a coherent framework-the Socially Dynamic Communications Framework (SDCF)-which the authors propose as a method of developing and integrating innovative communications processes involving online media.""
  - ""This study was carried out according to a Narrative Synthesis (NS) framework using a process developed originally by Popay et al. (2006) and further refined by Roen et al. (2006), Arai et al. (2007), and Rodgers et al. (2009)""
  - ""The selection of NS for use in this study reflects the need to create thematic coherence among data sets (both qualitative and quantitative), in order to categorise key areas of challenge and relevant solutions, in a largely unexplored, interdisciplinary area.""
  - ""The 73 selected papers, discussing potential challenges and solutions relevant to the area of engagement with energy sustainability, were compiled and studied for relationships suggesting common themes or categories (see Popay, 2006 , ""thematic analysis"", p. 18).""
  - ""The proposal of the SDCF aligns with the NS method of developing conceptual models based upon review findings in order to link together key issues and key processes (Popay et al., 2006).""

  - ""Studies were independently checked by the authors and their evaluations were cross-matched and discussed.""
  - ""We have to point out a possible bias. The studies of Joynt and Kang [35] and Yang et al. [9] included participants regardless of noise exposure from two Universities. The other three studies, on the other hand, purposely assessed the buffering effects of vegetation in individuals exposed to chronic noise pollution: In the studies of Gidlöf-Gunnarsson and Öhrström's [34] and Li et al. [33] noise was above 60 dB and the participants in the experiment of Maffei et al. [36] lived close to a railway line.""
  - ""We also had initial disagreement about the validity of the procedure for noise pollution measurement described by Gidlöf-Gunnarsson and Öhrström's [34] , which did not infl uence the fi nal quality appraisal; we also disagreed on the quality of the study of Joynt and Kang, [35] the one that found vegetation ineffective as a noise buffer: Donka Dimitrova evaluated it of low quality because of inadequate recruitment [Table 5""",,"- The paper mentions that data extraction was done independently by the authors, indicating their role in data collection.
- The authors discussed and resolved discrepancies, suggesting collaboration in the analysis process.
- The authors independently checked studies and cross-matched evaluations, indicating their involvement in quality assessment.
