Body size affects the evolution of eyespots in caterpillars,"Thomas John Hossie, John Skelhorn, Jesse W Breinholt, Akito Y Kawahara, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,50,2015,Hossie_2015.pdf,yes,"  - """"Conflict of interests: The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.""""",,"- The paper explicitly states that the authors declare they have no conflict of interest. This is a direct statement from the authors regarding their potential conflicts of interest.
- The statement is clear and unambiguous, indicating that the authors have disclosed their conflict of interest status."
Deflective effect and the effect of prey detectability on anti-predator function of eyespots,"Adrian Vallin, Marina Dimitrova, Ullasa Kodandaramaiah, Sami Merilaita, D Kemp",-,-,Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology,38,2011,Vallin_2011.pdf,not declared specifically,"  - ""The experimental protocol and housing of birds was reviewed and approved by the regional ethical committee in Linköping (Dnr: 62-08).""",,"- The paper mentions that the experimental protocol was reviewed and approved by an ethical committee, which suggests that ethical considerations were taken into account.
- However, there is no specific mention of a ""Conflict of interests"" section or any disclosure related to conflicts of interest in the provided text.
- The absence of a specific statement about conflicts of interest suggests that it was not declared specifically in the paper."
Eyespots interact with body colour to protect caterpillar-like prey from avian predators,"Thomas John Hossie, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,Animal Behaviour,37,2012,Hossie_2012.pdf,not declared specifically,"  - ""Pastry caterpillars were designed to be fully palatable to birds, and our experimental design was approved by the Carleton University Research Ethics Committee (Protocol B10-14).""
  - ""Ó 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.""",,"- The paper does not explicitly mention any conflict of interests or disclose any potential conflicts.
- The mention of the Carleton University Research Ethics Committee approval suggests adherence to ethical standards but does not address conflicts of interest.
- The copyright and publication information does not imply any conflict of interest."
Field experiments on the effectiveness of 'eyespots' as predator deterrents,"Martin Stevens, Elinor Hopkins, William Hinde, Amabel Adcock, Yvonne Connolly, Tom Troscianko, Innes C Cuthill, K T Troscianko",-,-,-,-,-,Stevens_2007.pdf,yes,"  - """"The authors declare no conflict of interest.""""",,"- The paper explicitly states that ""The authors declare no conflict of interest."" This indicates that the authors have disclosed their conflict of interest status, which is that they have no conflicts to declare."
Significance of butterfly eyespots as an anti-predator device in ground-based and aerial attacks,"Anne Lyytinen, Paul M Brakefield, Johanna Mappes",-,-,,93,2003,Lyytinen_2003.pdf,not declared specifically,"  - ""We did not find eyespots to be advantageous to butterflies when the attack came from the ground level or from above.""
  - ""In our experiments, lizards and birds preyed upon butterflies which were at rest or feeding on a banana slice, and hence the possible differences in activity levels or escape efficiency of butterfly forms did not influence the results.""
  - ""Further experiments are required to test these alternative explanations in more natural situations.""
  - ""We suggest two possible alternative hypotheses to account for the occurrence of spotted and spotless butterfly forms.""",,"- The paper discusses the experimental findings and hypotheses related to the function of butterfly eyespots as an anti-predator device.
- The authors present their results and discuss potential biases or limitations in their study, such as the experimental setup and the behavior of the predators.
- There is no mention of any conflict of interests or any declaration of such conflicts in the provided text.
- The focus is on the scientific findings and hypotheses rather than any personal or financial interests that might influence the research."
The Feeding Behaviour of Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) in the Presence of 'Eyes',"I R Inglis, L W Huson, M B Marshall, P A Arid,  Neville",-,-,-,-,-,Inglis_1983.pdf,not declared specifically,"  - ""The experimental procedure was designed to provide a relevant and objective, interval scale of aversiveness based upon the ability of eye patterns to deter hungry birds from a feeding area.""
  - ""The starling was chosen as the subject species because it is a widespread agricultural pest (see FEARE 1980) and because wild caught starlings adapt well to experimental conditions in the laboratory.""
  - ""The present study investigates the ability of eye-like patterns to deter hungry starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) from feeding with a view to the potential use of such stimuli as bird scarers.""",,"- The paper discusses the use of eye-like patterns as bird scarers, which could imply a potential conflict of interest if the authors or their institutions have a stake in the development or marketing of such bird scaring techniques.
- The study focuses on starlings as they are considered agricultural pests, which might suggest a conflict of interest if the research is funded by agricultural interests or if the authors have ties to industries affected by starling populations.
- However, there is no explicit mention of any conflict of interest in the provided text. The paper does not disclose any specific conflicts of interest, nor does it mention any funding sources or affiliations that could indicate a conflict."
The position of eyespots and thickened segments influence their protective value to caterpillars,"John Skelhorn, Giles Dorrington, Thomas J Hossie, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,,16,2014,Skelhorn_2014.pdf,not declared specifically,"  - ""Supplementary material can be found at http://www.beheco. oxfordjournals.org/""",,"- The paper does not explicitly mention any conflict of interests within the text.
- The mention of supplementary material does not relate to conflicts of interests but rather to additional information that may be found online.
- There is no section or statement in the paper that addresses conflicts of interests, which is typically included in scientific publications to disclose any potential biases or financial interests."
"The protective value of conspicuous signals is not impaired by shape, size, or position asymmetry","Martin Stevens, Sarah A Castor-Perry, Jessica R F Price",-,-,,19,2009,Stevens&CastorPerry_2009.pdf,yes,"  - """"The authors declare no conflict of interest.""""",,"- The paper explicitly states that ""The authors declare no conflict of interest."" This indicates that the authors have disclosed whether there is a conflict of interest or not.
- The statement is clear and direct, leaving no ambiguity about the authors' declaration regarding conflicts of interest."
