Bright light at night alters the perception of daylength in Indian weaver bird (Ploceus philippinus),"Jayant Kumar, Shalie Malik, Sanjay Kumar Bhardwaj, Sangeeta Rani",-,-,Journal of Experimental Zoology Part A Ecological and Integrative Physiology,17,2018,Kumar_2018.pdf,fluorescent lamp,"  - ""Each chamber contained two lamps, of which only one was lit at a time providing illumination at the level of cage floor.""
  - ""the bright light (∼2 lux) treatment at night was given in two patterns.""
  - ""Light intensity was measured by a Q203 Quantum Radiometer (Macam Photometrix Ltd., Scotland, UK).""

- The description of covering the CFL with a hood to diffuse the light suggests that the primary light source was indeed fluorescent.
- There is no mention of other types of lamps such as LED, incandescent, halogen, or streetlights, so we can conclude that the primary light source used in the study was fluorescent lamps."

  - ""Initially, both squirrels and mice were housed in the chronocubicle for entrainment to 12:12 h LD cycle for 1 week followed by their random allocation into following groups for experimental phase (n = 10/group): control (LD), placed in 12:12 h LD schedule for 4 weeks, constant darkness (DD), housed under the continuous dark condition for 4 weeks, constant light (LL), housed in continuous light condition (250 lux at cage level) for 4 weeks.""

- The mention of ""250 lux at cage level"" indicates the intensity of the light but not the type of lamp used.
- The use of ""dim red light"" for sampling during the dark phase suggests a specific type of lighting condition but again does not specify the type of lamp.
- The table at the end of the paper provides summary results but does not mention the type of light source used.
- The paper does not explicitly mention any specific type of lamp such as LED, fluorescent, incandescent, halogen, or streetlight."
