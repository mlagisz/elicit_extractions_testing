Behavioral effects of triadimefon in zebrafish are associated with alterations of the dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways,"Susana Paredes-Zúñiga, Nils Trost, Javiera F De La Paz, Julio Alcayaga, Miguel L Allende",-,-,Progress in Neuro-psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry,29,2019,zuniga_2019.pdf,yes,"  - ""Authors declare no conflicts of interest.""",,"- The authors explicitly state that they declare no conflicts of interest, which indicates that they have disclosed their conflict of interest status.
- Additionally, they mention that the founding sponsors had no role in any part of the study or publication process, which further supports the lack of conflicts of interest.
- The explicit declaration of no conflicts of interest by the authors aligns with the predefined answer ""yes,"" indicating that the conflict of interests was disclosed by the authors."
Carbofuran induces increased anxiety-like behaviors in female zebrafish (Danio rerio) through disturbing dopaminergic/ norepinephrinergic system,"Shuang Liu, Miao Yu, Xincen Xie, Yiran Ru, Shaoguo Ru, David Volz",-,-,-,-,-,liu_2020.pdf,yes,"  - ""The authors declare no conflicts of interest.""",,"- The paper explicitly states that ""The authors declare no conflicts of interest."" This indicates that the authors have made a declaration regarding conflicts of interest.
- The statement is clear and direct, leaving no ambiguity about whether conflicts of interest were disclosed or not.
- Since the authors have explicitly declared that there are no conflicts of interest, it is clear that they have addressed the issue of conflicts of interest in their paper."
"Embryonic atrazine exposure and later in life behavioral and brain transcriptomic, epigenetic, and pathological alterations in adult male zebrafish","Katharine A Horzmann, Li F Lin, Boghos Taslakjian, Chongli Yuan, Jennifer L Freeman",-,-,Cell Biology and Toxicology,21,2020,horzmann_2022.pdf,yes,"  - ""The authors declare that they have no competing interests.""",,"- The paper explicitly states that the authors declare they have no competing interests. This is a direct statement regarding the conflict of interests.
- The phrase ""The authors declare that they have no competing interests"" is a standard way to disclose that there are no conflicts of interest in scientific publications."
Neurobehavioral Impairments Caused by Developmental Imidacloprid Exposure in Zebrafish,"Emily B Crosby, Jordan M Bailey, Anthony N Oliveri, Edward D Levin",-,-,Neurotoxicology and Teratology,145,2015,crosby_2015.pdf,not declared specifically,"  - ""The procedures were approved by the Duke University Institutional Review Committee for the use of animal subjects.""",,"- The paper mentions that the procedures were approved by the Duke University Institutional Review Committee for the use of animal subjects. This indicates that the study was conducted under ethical guidelines and oversight, but it does not directly address any potential conflicts of interest.
- There is no explicit mention of any conflicts of interest or financial disclosures in the provided text. This suggests that the authors did not declare any specific conflicts of interest in the paper."
Quantitative assessment of cypermethrin induced behavioural and biochemical anomalies in adult zebrafish,"Shubham Nema, Yogesh Bhargava",-,-,Neurotoxicology and Teratology,21,2018,nema_2018.pdf,yes,"  - ""All authors declare having no conflict of interest.""",,#NAME?
The organophosphate insecticide diazinon and aging: Neurobehavioral and mitochondrial effects in zebrafish exposed as embryos or during aging,"Jonna Boyda, Andrew B Hawkey, Zade R Holloway, Rafael Trevisan, Richard T Di Giulio, Edward D Levin, G A Richardson",-,-,Neurotoxicology and Teratology,16,2021,boyda_2021.pdf,yes,"  - ""The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.""",,"- The paper explicitly states that the authors declare no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have influenced the work.
- This statement is a direct disclosure of conflict of interests, indicating that the authors have no conflicts to report."
"Tributyltin enhanced anxiety of adult male zebrafish through elevating cortisol level and disruption in serotonin, dopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid neurotransmitter pathways","Xin Tu, Ying-Wen Li, Qi-Liang Chen, Yan-Jun Shen, Zhi-Hao Liu",-,-,Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,40,2020,tu_2020.pdf,yes,"  - ""The authors have declared that no conflict of interest exists.""",,"- The paper explicitly states that the authors have declared no conflict of interest. This is a direct statement from the authors regarding their conflict of interest status.
- The statement is clear and unambiguous, indicating that the authors have made a declaration about their conflict of interest status."
Zebrafish provide a sensitive model of persisting neurobehavioral effects of developmental chlorpyrifos exposure: Comparison with nicotine and pilocarpine effects and relationship to dopamine deficits,"Donnie Eddins, Daniel Cerutti, Paul Williams, Elwood Linney, Edward D Levin",-,-,Neurotoxicology and Teratology,232,2010,eddins_2010.pdf,not declared specifically,"  - ""The experimental protocol was approved by the Duke University Institutional Committee for the use of animal subjects.""",,"- The paper mentions that the experimental protocol was approved by the Duke University Institutional Committee for the use of animal subjects, which is a standard ethical procedure but does not directly address conflicts of interest.
- There is no explicit mention of conflicts of interest or any declaration regarding financial or personal interests that could influence the research.
- The absence of a specific section or statement regarding conflicts of interest suggests that it was not declared specifically in the paper."
