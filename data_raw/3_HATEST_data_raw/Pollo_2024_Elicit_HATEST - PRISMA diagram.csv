  - ""We excluded the well-known study of Oberhauser (1989) as it conflated male mating history and male age.""
  - ""We classified species on the basis of mating pattern and taxonomic group (Table 2""
  - ""We calculated mean effect sizes weighted for sample size (sampling variance) using MetaWin 2.0 (Rosenberg et al. 2000).""
  - ""We calculated Rosenthal's fail-safe number to assess the robustness of our results.""
  - ""To indirectly test for publication bias, we calculated the Begg-Mazumdar correlation between standardised effect size and sample size (r-bias).""
  - ""We also used the ""trim and fill"" method of Duvall and Tweedie (2000) to estimate the number of ""missing"" studies based on a funnel plot of the data (i.e. effect size vs sample size) and then calculated the mean effect if these hypothetical ""missing"" studies are included.""",,"- The paper describes a meta-analysis that involved compiling data from 29 studies of 25 Lepidopteran species. This indicates that a systematic search and screening of literature were conducted.
- The authors mention consulting scientific literature databases and previous reviews, which suggests a structured approach to identifying relevant studies.
- The exclusion of certain studies, such as the one by Oberhauser (1989), indicates a process of screening and selection based on specific criteria.
- The use of MetaWin 2.0 for calculating mean effect sizes and testing for heterogeneity suggests a systematic approach to data analysis.
- The calculation of Rosenthal's fail-safe number and the use of the ""trim and fill"" method to assess publication bias further indicate a structured methodology.
- However, there is no mention of a PRISMA diagram or a flowchart detailing the search and screening process in the provided text."

  - ""Using our meta-analysis data set (Janicke et al. 2016), we tested for systematic changes in the opportunity for sexual selection (I s ) and the Bateman gradient (b ss ) arising from the use of genetic mating success (gMS) instead of copulatory mating success (cMS).""
  - ""We scrutinize the quantification of (sex differences in) sexual selection metrics with respect to three components: the underlying study design (section 'Study design'), data collection (section 'Data collection'), and parameter estimation (section 'Parameter estimation').""
  - ""Drawing from a recent meta-analysis, we evaluate potential biases arising from study design, data collection and parameter estimation, and provide suggestions to mitigate such biases in future studies.""",,"- The paper mentions a ""recent meta-analysis"" and uses a ""meta-analysis data set"" to evaluate biases and test hypotheses, indicating that a systematic review was conducted.
- The paper does not explicitly mention a PRISMA diagram or a flowchart detailing the search and screening process of the literature.
- The focus of the paper is on evaluating biases and providing guidelines for future studies rather than detailing the search and screening process of the literature.

  - ""targeting peer-reviewed research published between 1900 and May 2019. This returned a total of 356 publications.""
  - ""Of these, we excluded 102 human studies. We then filtered out 113 articles that were clearly not about mate-choice copying and 51 articles that lacked empirical data (e.g., reviews, theoretical models, or opinion papers).""
  - ""We excluded nine studies that did not experimentally assess mate-choice copying directly or at all.""
  - ""We further excluded 24 studies that assessed mate-choice copying but did not determine individual choices.""
  - ""Finally, we excluded three studies quantifying male mate-choice copying because these studies identified audience effects (described above) on male behavior that are logically separate from selective pressures on female behavior.""
  - ""We were left with 40 empirical studies reporting 103 separate experiments that tested directly for female mate-choice copying (Figure 1""",,"- The paper describes a systematic search and screening process for identifying relevant studies, which is a key component of a PRISMA diagram.
- The authors detail the inclusion and exclusion criteria for studies, which is typically represented in a PRISMA diagram.

The relative importance of size and asymmetry in sexual selection,"R Thornhid', A P M0ller, A P Moller",-,-,,88,1998,Thornhill_1998.pdf,insufficient,"  - ""The data set used for the present study is from Mailer and Thornhill (1998), which was based on (1) a comprehensive search of the literature and of the Internet for information on the relationship between asymmetry and sexual selection, and (2) correspondence between the authors and behavioral ecologists conducting research on this relationship.""
  - ""the data are presented in Table 1""
  - ""The aim of the present study was to test whether the magnitude of the effect of asymmetry on sexual selection was similar to that of character size per se, which is known from numerous studies to be related to sexual selection (see review in Andersson, 1994).""",,"- The paper mentions a ""comprehensive search of the literature and of the Internet"" and correspondence with researchers, which suggests that a systematic search and screening process were conducted to gather data.
- The data used in the study were derived from a previous meta-analysis by Mailer and Thornhill (1998), indicating that the data collection process involved reviewing existing literature.

- The PRISMA diagram is a specific tool used to illustrate the flow of studies through the systematic review process, but the paper does not explicitly mention or include such a diagram."
Variation in pre-and post-copulatory sexual selection on male genital size in two species of lygaeid bug,"Liam R Dougherty, David M Shuker",-,-,Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology,18,2016,Dougherty_2016.pdf,not applicable,"  - ""We also attempted to combine these episodes of selection by examining the postcopulatory success of all males (including those that did not mate), giving an estimate of the overall selection acting on processus length.""
  - ""The strength of post-copulatory sexual selection on processus length in L. simulans across these different studies was estimated using formal meta-analysis.""
  - ""Finally, we assessed how the strength of selection varied across studies in L. simulans by using formal metaanalysis to combine selection gradients reported in previous studies with those found here.""

- The study involves experimental data collection and analysis rather than a systematic review or meta-analysis of existing literature.
- The paper does not mention any literature search or screening process, which is typically associated with a PRISMA diagram.
- The use of meta-analysis in the paper is to combine results from their own experiments with previous studies, not to systematically review and screen literature."
