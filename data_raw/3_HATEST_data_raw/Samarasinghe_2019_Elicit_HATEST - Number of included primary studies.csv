  - ""Of 19,005 potential articles, we fully read 530 and included 100 in our analysistwo of which were PhD theses""
  - ""One hundred articles from peer-reviewed and grey literature examining built environmental attributes related to total PA met inclusion criteria and relevant information was extracted.""",,"- The paper explicitly states that ""One hundred articles from peer-reviewed and grey literature examining built environmental attributes related to total PA met inclusion criteria and relevant information was extracted."" This indicates that 100 articles were included in the systematic review.
- The statement ""Of 19,005 potential articles, we fully read 530 and included 100 in our analysis—two of which were PhD theses"" further confirms that 100 articles were included in the analysis.

Economic analysis of the health impacts of housing improvement studies: a systematic review,"Elisabeth Fenwick, Catriona Macdonald, Hilary Thomson",-,-,Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health,35,2013,Fenwick_2013.pdf,45,"  - ""Studies investigating the health impacts of housing improvement have frequently provided some details on costs or economic analysis (n=29/45).""
  - ""Data were extracted from all studies included in the systematic review of housing improvement which had reported costs and economic analysis (n=29/45).""
  - ""Forty-five studies were identified in the original review.""",,"- The paper mentions that data were extracted from studies included in the systematic review of housing improvement, specifically those that reported costs and economic analysis. This is indicated by the phrase ""n=29/45,"" which suggests that out of 45 studies, 29 had relevant data on costs and economic analysis.
- The phrase ""Forty-five studies were identified in the original review"" directly states the total number of studies included in the systematic review.
- The mention of ""n=29/45"" in another context reinforces that the total number of studies in the original review was 45, but only 29 of these had data on costs and economic analysis."
Impacts of heat waves and corresponding measures: a review,"Jian Zuo, Stephen Pullen, Jasmine Palmer, Helen Bennetts, Nicholas Chileshe, Tony Ma",-,-,,242,2015,Zuo_2015.pdf,173,"  - ""The aim of this research is to present a critical review of impacts of heat waves and corresponding mechanisms. A list of keywords was used to search related papers and reports. These keywords include: extreme weather conditions; heat waves; hot spell; health; overheating; mechanisms; building, etc. As a result, 173 papers and reports were selected to be critically reviewed in this study.""
  - ""The papers published in international journals and conference proceedings covered the heat wave related studies in both Australia and overseas.""",,"- The paper explicitly states that the study involved a critical review of 173 papers and reports related to heat waves and their impacts.
- The mention of ""173 papers and reports"" indicates the number of primary studies included in the systematic review.
- The context suggests that these papers and reports were selected based on specific keywords related to heat waves, indicating they are primary studies relevant to the review."
Latent heat storage in building elements: A systematic review on properties and contextual performance factors,"A Mavrigiannaki, E Ampatzi",-,-,,78,2016,Mavrigiannaki_2016.pdf,120,"  - ""The review of a total of 120 papers revealed that published information on these aspects is diverse and in many cases insufficient.""
  - ""Fig. 3 presents data availability in the 120 papers considered, revealing that very few papers offered data for extraction for all aspects reviewed.""
  - ""The search process tracked 140 studies to be reviewed. These covered a variety of building elements; more popular being walls (Fig. 2 ). Following the review, 20 papers were identified as inappropriate for data extraction and were excluded from the analysis.""",,"- The paper explicitly states that the review included a total of 120 papers, as indicated in the first quote.
- The second quote mentions that 140 studies were initially tracked, but 20 were excluded due to lack of necessary data, which aligns with the final number of 120 papers included in the review.
- The third quote further confirms that the review considered data from 120 papers, reinforcing the number of included primary studies."
Online engagement for sustainable energy projects: A Systematic review and framework for integration,Danielle Barrios-O'neill,-,-,,34,2016,Barrios-ONeill_2016.pdf,73,"  - ""In total 73 papers were included, falling within the topic areas of environmental planning, energy and infrastructure (50 papers apply to this topic); marketing and business (25 papers); community planning, consultation/public engagement and consultation policy (31 papers); and (interactive) media engagement (48 papers), where most selected studies involve more than one of the topic areas listed.5""

  - ""A total of 12 databases was used resulting in the identification of 147 total studies based on the following inclusion criteria: 1) objectives and outcomes relate to central research question of the review 1 ;

2) contain prescriptions and guidance;

3) are available in downloadable/printable format.""",,"- The paper initially identified 147 studies from 12 databases based on specific inclusion criteria.
- After applying exclusion criteria, the number of studies was narrowed down to 70.
- However, the paper mentions that three additional items were included after the original search process, which were deemed relevant, bringing the total number of included studies to 73."
Relationship between the physical environment and different domains of physical activity in European adults: a systematic review,"Veerle Van Holle, Benedicte Deforche, Jelle Van Cauwenberg, Liesbet Goubert, Lea Maes, Nico Van De Weghe, Ilse De Bourdeaudhuij",-,-,BMC Public Health,317,2012,VanHolle_2012.pdf,70,"  - ""After excluding duplicates and making exclusions based on title and abstract, 73 papers remained. Twenty of these studies were excluded based on full text. Backward screening of the remaining 53 papers' reference lists and forward screening of citations yielded 17 more papers, resulting in a total amount of 70 eligible papers for this review.""
  - ""Seventy eligible papers were identified through systematic searches across six electronic databases.""",,"- The paper explicitly states that ""Seventy eligible papers were identified through systematic searches across six electronic databases."" This indicates the initial number of studies considered for inclusion.
- However, the process of exclusion and additional screening resulted in a final total of ""70 eligible papers for this review."" This is the number of primary studies that were actually included in the systematic review."

  - ""Sixty three papers estimating future mortality from high temperatures and heat waves have been reviewed.""",,"- The paper explicitly states that after removing duplicate entries, 63 articles were found to contain quantitative estimates of future heat-related mortality.
- This number is confirmed in another part of the paper, indicating that 63 papers were reviewed.
- The tables at the end of the paper list the details of these studies, but the total number of included primary studies is clearly stated in the text."
