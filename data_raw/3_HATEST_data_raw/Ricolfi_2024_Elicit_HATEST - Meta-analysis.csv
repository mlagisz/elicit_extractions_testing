Association between maternal exposure to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances and risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Zhuoma Deji, Peng Liu, Xin Wang, Xin Zhang, Yuehua Luo, Zhenzhen Huang",-,-,Science of the Total Environment,39,2021,Deji_2021.pdf,yes,"  - ""The first meta-analysis on maternal PFASs exposure and adverse pregnancy outcomes was performed.""
  - ""a systematic review and meta-analysis of twenty-one published articles was conducted to explore the association between maternal exposure to PFASs and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including miscarriage, stillbirth and preterm birth.""
  - ""A random-effects model meta-analysis was performed to calculate pooled effect estimates and investigate the associations between PFASs and miscarriage, stillbirth or preterm birth.""
  - ""The results of the meta-analysis indicated that maternal exposure to PFASs did not increase the risk of miscarriage.""
  - ""The pooled effect estimates from all the six studies on the association between PFASs exposure and miscarriage suggested no statistical significance.""
  - ""The combined results suggested a positive relationship between maternal exposure to PFOS and the risk of preterm birth.""
  - ""Publication bias was monitored for maternal PFASs (PFOA and PFOS) exposure and preterm birth by Egger's test and funnel plots, because the number of the total studies for these outcome measures is more than ten.""
  - ""In summary, this meta-analysis work based on twenty-one studies was intended to examine possible relationships between PFASs exposure in maternal period and three adverse pregnancy outcomes.""",,"- The paper explicitly states that it is the ""first meta-analysis on maternal PFASs exposure and adverse pregnancy outcomes,"" indicating that a meta-analysis was conducted.
- The authors mention that a ""systematic review and meta-analysis of twenty-one published articles"" was conducted, which confirms the inclusion of a meta-analysis.
- The use of a ""random-effects model meta-analysis"" to calculate pooled effect estimates further supports the presence of a meta-analysis.
- The paper provides results from the meta-analysis, such as the association between PFASs exposure and miscarriage and preterm birth, which are typical outcomes of a meta-analysis.
- The mention of meta-regression analysis and subgroup analysis, as well as the monitoring of publication bias, are additional indicators that a meta-analysis was performed."
ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANT EXPOSURES AND PRETERM BIRTH: A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW,"Kelly K Ferguson, Marie S O'neill, John D Meeker",-,-,"Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health. Part B, Critical Reviews",148,2013,Ferguson_2013.pdf,yes,"  - ""Additional studies with robust study designs emphasizing larger numbers of preterm deliveries are necessary.""
  - ""a large metaanalysis of studies from ENRIECO and OBELIX cohorts examining the relationships between POP exposure and several birth outcomes, no marked association was observed between PCB-153 and gestational age in any individual study or overall (Govarts et al., 2012).""
  - ""In conclusion, no consistent evidence was found for positive associations between individual chemical exposures and preterm birth.""",,"- The paper mentions a ""large metaanalysis"" conducted by Govarts et al. (2012) in the context of examining relationships between POP exposure and birth outcomes. This indicates that a meta-analysis was indeed included in the review.
- The mention of this meta-analysis suggests that the review does include a quantitative synthesis of information from multiple sources, which is the definition of a meta-analysis.
- The paper does not conduct its own meta-analysis but references an existing one, which is still relevant to the question of whether the review includes a meta-analysis."

  - ""Two recent meta-analyses of 16 and 24 studies (69,70), found decreases in birth weight of 12.8 g (69) and 10.5 g (70) with 1 ng/ml increases in PFOA in maternal and cord blood, respectively.""",,"- The paper mentions specific meta-analyses conducted on the effects of PFAS on birth weight, indicating that these analyses were part of the review process.
- The mention of PRISMA guidelines suggests that the review followed a structured approach that includes meta-analysis as a method for synthesizing data.
- The specific results from meta-analyses are provided, such as the decrease in birth weight associated with increases in PFOA and PFOS levels, which indicates that the review included quantitative synthesis of data from multiple studies."
Human exposure pathways to poly-and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from indoor media: A systematic review,"Nicole M Deluca, Jeffrey M Minucci, Ashley Mullikin, Rachel Slover, Elaine A Cohen Hubal, Adrian Covaci, B S T R A C T",-,-,-,-,-,DeLuca_2022.pdf,no,"  - ""Two studies that reported PFAS measurements in indoor air showed that inhalation of PFAS could account for less than 4% of serum PFOA concentrations and less than 2% of serum PFOS and PFNA concentrations.""
  - ""Results of this evidence synthesis showed that exposure to PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, and PFHxS from contaminated house dust could account for 13%, 3%, 7%, and 25% of serum concentrations, respectively.""
  - ""The strength of evidence tool developed in the protocol for this systematic review (DeLuca et al., 2021) and used above would suggest that the overall weight of evidence was high.""
  - ""The strength of evidence was considered ""moderate"" at the beginning of the assessment and either ""increased strength"" or ""decreased strength"" based on the risk of bias across studies, consistency, strength (effect magnitude) and precision, and coherence.""
  - ""The systematic review used a modified version of the strength of evidence tool for epidemiology studies described in EPA's Systematic Review Protocol for the PFBA, PFHxA, PFHxS, PFNA, and PFDA IRIS Assessments (U.S. EPA, 2019) that can be found in the supplemental material of DeLuca et al. (2021).""",,"- The paper describes a systematic review that synthesizes evidence from multiple studies to estimate the contribution of indoor exposure pathways to serum PFAS levels.
- The review uses a strength of evidence tool to assess the quality and consistency of the evidence, which is a common approach in systematic reviews.
- The paper provides quantitative estimates of the percentage of serum PFAS concentrations attributed to indoor exposure pathways, which suggests a quantitative synthesis of data.
- However, the paper does not explicitly mention conducting a meta-analysis, which typically involves statistical methods to combine data from multiple studies.
- The focus on synthesizing evidence and providing quantitative estimates suggests that while the review does involve quantitative synthesis, it may not meet the specific criteria for a meta-analysis as typically defined in scientific literature."

  - ""A considerable time range was selected to cover a significant number of studies and to verify possible changes in pollutant concentrations over time.""
  - ""The general overview of the knowledge gaps and the next step to be taken in Latin American science are summarized in Table 5""",,"- The paper describes itself as a ""critical review,"" which typically involves a qualitative synthesis of existing literature rather than a quantitative meta-analysis.
- The review compiles data from multiple sources but does not mention any statistical synthesis or quantitative analysis of these data, which is characteristic of a meta-analysis.
- The focus is on summarizing and discussing the findings from various studies rather than combining them statistically.
- The paper includes tables and figures that summarize the distribution and levels of pollutants, but these are descriptive rather than quantitative syntheses.
- The methodology described involves selecting and summarizing studies based on specific criteria, but there is no mention of statistical pooling or meta-analysis techniques."

Perfluoroalkyl substances and lipid concentrations in the blood: A systematic review of epidemiological studies,"Soon Hoe Ho, Stacy Xin, Hui Soh, Min Xian Wang, Janet Ong, Annabel Seah, Yvonne Wong, Zhanxiong Fang, Shuzhen Sim, Jue Tao Lim, C L E I N F O, Adrian Covaci",-,-,Science of the Total Environment,50,2022,Ho_2022.pdf,no,"  - ""While this method would not yield a single pooled effect size unlike in a meta-analysis, it still allowed us to adequately address the question motivating the review: whether PFAS exposure is associated with the four lipid indices in human populations.""
  - ""Instead, we chose to synthesise the various effect sizes by vote counting the positive and negative effect directions (McKenzie and Brennan, 2022).""
  - ""Due to substantial heterogeneity in the type of statistical analysis performed in different articles, such as whether exposure-outcome associations were assessed by correlation and/or regression, the number of covariates controlled for in regression models, the PFAS and lipid concentration units and any transformations to them (e.g. log 10 or ln), and whether PFAS concentrations were treated as continuous or categorical (ordinal) variables, the effect sizes were often not directly comparable between articles; hence we decided against performing a meta-analysis.""",,"- The paper explicitly states that due to the heterogeneity in statistical analyses across different articles, a meta-analysis was not performed. This is because the effect sizes from various studies were not directly comparable.
- Instead of a meta-analysis, the authors used a vote counting method to synthesize the effect directions, which is an alternative approach to quantitative synthesis.
- The paper clearly indicates that no meta-analysis was conducted, as it would not have been feasible given the variability in statistical methods used across the studies."
