Can the way pigs are handled alter behavioural and physiological measures of affective state?,"Ricard Carreras, Laura Arroyo, Eva Mainau, Daniel Valent, Anna Bassols, Antoni Dalmau, Luigi Faucitano, Xavier Manteca, Antonio Velarde",-,-,Behavioural Processes,16,2017,Carreras2017.pdf,captive,"  - ""At 9 weeks of age, pigs were transported from a commercial farm to the experimental facilities of IRTA (Monells, Spain) and housed in two rooms of four pens with seven pigs each.""
  - ""In this study, 56 female pigs ((Landrace x Large White) x Piétrain) were used.""",,"- The paper mentions that the pigs were transported from a ""commercial farm"" to the experimental facilities, which suggests that the pigs were already in captivity before being used in the study.
- The fact that they were transported from a commercial farm indicates that they were not wild-caught, as wild-caught animals would not be obtained from a farm setting.
- The study does not mention any wild-caught animals or any process of capturing animals from the wild, further supporting the conclusion that the animals were captive."
"Does stocking density modify affective state in pigs as assessed by cognitive bias, behavioural and physiological parameters?","Annalisa Scollo, Flaviana Gottardo, Barbara Contiero, Sandra A Edwards",-,-,,62,2014,Scollo2014.pdf,captive,"  - ""All the pigs were ear tagged for individual identification.""
  - ""A total of 40 entire male and female crossbred pigs (Large White × Landrace), which had previously experienced the same housing and management conditions, were selected at approximately 14 weeks of age and 45 kg live weight.""",,"- The paper mentions that the pigs were ""selected at approximately 14 weeks of age and 45 kg live weight,"" which suggests that they were already in a controlled environment and not wild-caught.
- The fact that the pigs were ""ear tagged for individual identification"" further indicates that they were in a captive setting, as this is a common practice in animal husbandry and research.
- There is no mention of the pigs being wild-caught or sourced from the wild, which supports the conclusion that they were captive."
Effect of gender and halothane genotype on cognitive bias and its relationship with fear in pigs,"Ricard Carreras, Laura Arroyo, Eva Mainau, Raquel Pe Ña, Anna Bassols, Antoni Dalmau, Luigi Faucitano, Xavier Manteca, Antonio Velarde",-,-,,17,2016,Carreras2016.pdf,captive,"  - ""At 9 weeks of age, pigs were transported from a commercial farm to the experimental facilities of IRTA (Monells, Spain) and housed separately by gender and genotype in 8 pens (6 pigs per pen).""
  - ""In this study, 48 crossbred pigs (Landrace × Large White sows sired with Piétrain boars) were divided into four groups of 12 pigs each.""",,"- The paper mentions that the pigs were ""transported from a commercial farm to the experimental facilities,"" which indicates that the pigs were obtained from a commercial farm. This suggests that the pigs were not wild-caught but were instead sourced from a captive environment.
- The description of the pigs as ""crossbred pigs (Landrace × Large White sows sired with Piétrain boars)"" further supports the idea that they were bred in captivity, as this is a common practice in commercial farming."
"Effects of Cage Enrichment on Behavior, Welfare and Outcome Variability in Female Mice","Jeremy D Bailoo, Eimear Murphy, Maria Boada-Saña, Justin A Varholick, Sara Hintze, Caroline Baussière, Kerstin C Hahn, Christine Göpfert, Rupert Palme, Bernhard Voelkl, Hanno Würbel",-,-,Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience,85,2018,Bailoo_2018.pdf,captive,"  - ""Each batch was comprised of 48 newly weaned non-sibling mice (21-25 days old at delivery) per strain.""
  - ""Subjects were 192 female mice, 96 each of the inbred strain C57BL/6JRj (C57) and the outbred strain RjOrl:SWISS (SWISS) from Janvier Labs, France.""",,"- The paper specifies that the mice used in the study were obtained from Janvier Labs, France. This indicates that the mice were not wild-caught but were instead sourced from a laboratory animal supplier.
- The mention of ""newly weaned non-sibling mice"" further supports that the mice were bred in captivity, as they were already weaned and being delivered to the laboratory at a young age.
- The use of specific strains (C57BL/6JRj and RjOrl:SWISS) also suggests that these mice were bred for laboratory use, which is typical for captive-bred animals."
Frontal brain deactivation during a non-verbal cognitive judgement bias test in sheep,"Kathrin Guldimann, Sabine Vögeli, Martin Wolf, Beat Wechsler, Lorenz Gygax",-,-,Brain and Cognition,20,2015,Guldimann2015.pdf,captive,"  - ""To induce a positive mood, 15 sheep were housed in a generous open-front pen with access to an exercise yard on work days between 08:15 and 17:30 h providing a natural daylight rhythm.""
  - ""To induce a negative mood, a group of 14 sheep was continuously housed in an enclosed deep-litter pen where feed, water and daylight were provided daily at unpredictable times.""
  - ""To induce a relatively more negative or more positive mood, the sheep had been subjected to either unpredictable, stimulus-poor or predictable, stimulus-rich housing conditions, respectively, since July 2011 (Vögeli et al., 2014).""
  - ""24 focal sheep (12 from each housing group) that had previously been chosen at random were included in the cognitive judgement bias test.""
  - ""Twenty-nine female non-lactating and non-gestating Lacaune sheep about 2.5 years of age made up the two groups used in this experiment (Vögeli et al., 2014).""",,"- The paper describes the use of Lacaune sheep in the experiment, which are a breed commonly used in agricultural settings and research.
- The sheep were housed in controlled environments, such as enclosed deep-litter pens and open-front pens with access to exercise yards, indicating they were kept in captivity.
- The description of the housing conditions and the management of the sheep's environment suggests that the animals were not wild-caught but were instead maintained in a controlled, captive setting.
- There is no mention of the sheep being caught from the wild or any indication that they were not captive-bred or maintained animals."
"Measurement of cognitive bias and cortisol levels to evaluate the effects of space restriction on captive collared peccary (Mammalia, Tayassuidae)","Flávia R M Oliveira, Sérgio L G Nogueira-Filho, Maria B C Sousa, Carlos T S Dias, Michael Mendl, Selene S C Nogueira",-,-,,11,2016,Oliveira2016.pdf,captive,"  - ""The experimental animals, aged between 4 and 6 years old and weighing 23.0 ± 2.2 kg, were from the same herd (N = 23), born and raised in captive conditions.""
  - ""We carried out an experiment with six adult male collared peccaries (Pecari tajacu) at the Laboratório de Etologia Aplicada, Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruz, Brazil (14 • 47 39.8 S, 39 • 10 27.7 W).""",,"- The paper explicitly states that the experimental animals were ""born and raised in captive conditions,"" which indicates that they were not wild-caught but were instead captive-bred.
- The mention of the animals being from the same herd and being born and raised in captivity further supports that they were not wild-caught."
The effects of housing conditions on judgement bias in Japanese quail,"Mária Horváth, Katarína Pichová, L ' Ubor Košt'ál",-,-,,12,2016,Horvàth2016.pdf,captive,"  - ""Female Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) were hatched and reared at the Institute of Animal Biochemistry and Genetics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Ivanka pri Dunaji, Slovak Republic.""",,"- The paper explicitly states that the Japanese quails were ""hatched and reared"" at the Institute of Animal Biochemistry and Genetics. This indicates that the quails were bred in captivity rather than being wild-caught.
- The mention of the quails being ""hatched and reared"" at a specific institute suggests that they were part of a controlled breeding program, which is typical for captive animals used in scientific research."
Validation of a novel cognitive bias task based on difference in quantity of reinforcement for assessing environmental enrichment,"Heidi A Keen, O Lynne Nelson, Charles T Robbins, Marc Evans, David J Shepherdson, Ruth C Newberry",-,-,-,-,-,Keen2014.pdf,"captive, wild-caught","  - ""The untrained females (Cooke and Oakley) were brought to the facility as adults after removal from the wild. They had been at the facility for 2 years, and their ages were both estimated at 6-7 years.""
  - ""The males (Frank and John) were brought to the facility as juveniles and had been there for 9 years.""
  - ""Eight adult grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) from the Washington State University Bear Research, Education, and Conservation Center participated in this study.""",,"- The paper mentions that the study involved eight adult grizzly bears from the Washington State University Bear Research, Education, and Conservation Center.
- The males were brought to the facility as juveniles, indicating they were not wild-caught adults but rather captive-raised.
- The untrained females were brought to the facility as adults after removal from the wild, which suggests they were wild-caught.
- However, since all the bears were housed and studied at the facility, they were considered captive at the time of the study."
