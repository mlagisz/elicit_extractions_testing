Body size affects the evolution of eyespots in caterpillars,"Thomas John Hossie, John Skelhorn, Jesse W Breinholt, Akito Y Kawahara, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,50,2015,Hossie_2015.pdf,none,"  - ""Insectivorous bird species observed in each of the field locations are detailed in Table S3""
  - ""Field trials were conducted at three sites in Ontario, Canada (site 1: near the Ferguson Forest Centre, Kemptville, 45°03'00""N,""
  - ""W; site 2: University of Guelph, Kemptville campus, 44°59'48""N,""
  - ""W; site 3: Oxford Mills, 44°56'27""N,""
  - ""The entire process was repeated six times, for a total of 576 artificial prey deployed.""
  - ""Seventy-two female domestic chicks of the Novogen Brown strain (Gallus gallus domesticus) were purchased from a commercial hatchery on the day of hatching.""",,"- The paper mentions that the bird species used in the field experiment are detailed in Table S3, but this table is not included in the provided text.
- The paper does not specify the Latin binomial names of the bird species used in the field experiment within the text itself.
- The laboratory experiment used domestic chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus), but the question specifically asks for bird species used in the field experiment on the effects of conspicuous wing patterns such as eye-spots.
- Since the specific bird species are not mentioned in the text and only referenced in a table that is not provided, the answer must be ""none"" as per the instructions."
Deflective effect and the effect of prey detectability on anti-predator function of eyespots,"Adrian Vallin, Marina Dimitrova, Ullasa Kodandaramaiah, Sami Merilaita, D Kemp",-,-,Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology,38,2011,Vallin_2011.pdf,Cyanistes caeruleus,"  - ""In two experiments, we used artificial, triangular prey items and blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) as predators.""
  - ""We used wild caught blue tits, C. caeruleus, as predators, because they are insectivorous passerines and have been successfully used in previous predation experiments on butterflies and eyespots (e.g., Vallin et al. 2006Vallin et al. , 2007)).""",,"- The paper explicitly mentions that the bird species used in the experiments were ""blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus)"".
- The Latin binomial name for blue tits is provided as ""Cyanistes caeruleus"".
- There is no mention of any other bird species being used in the experiments."
Eyespots interact with body colour to protect caterpillar-like prey from avian predators,"Thomas John Hossie, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,Animal Behaviour,37,2012,Hossie_2012.pdf,none,"  - ""Insectivorous bird species observed in each of the field locations are detailed in Supplementary Table S2""
  - ""Preliminary scouting of each site confirmed the presence of Pa. canadensis adults, snakes, as well as several species of insectivorous birds.""",,"- The paper mentions that several species of insectivorous birds were observed at the field locations, but it does not specify the Latin binomial names of these birds in the main text.
- The information about the specific bird species is referred to in Supplementary Table S2, which is not included in the provided text.
- Since the specific bird species are not mentioned in the main text and the supplementary table is not provided, we cannot determine the exact bird species used in the experiment."
Field experiments on the effectiveness of 'eyespots' as predator deterrents,"Martin Stevens, Elinor Hopkins, William Hinde, Amabel Adcock, Yvonne Connolly, Tom Troscianko, Innes C Cuthill, K T Troscianko",-,-,-,-,-,Stevens_2007.pdf,none,"  - ""the blue tit Parus caeruleus (Hart et al. 2000), and for different daylight illuminants (cloudy and blue sky), to assess the robustness of our estimates.""
  - ""The starling was chosen as a typical passerine for which there are good data on double cone spectral sensitivity (Hart et al. 1998).""
  - ""They showed that the eyespots of the peacock butterfly would startle blue tits, Parus caeruleus, but the birds were not startled when the eyespots were removed.""
  - ""The main avian predators in the area were blue tits, great tits, Parus major, European robins, Erithacus rubecula, Chaffinches, Fringilla coelebs, and house sparrows, Passer domesticus.""",,"- The paper mentions several bird species as predators in the area where the experiments were conducted: blue tits, great tits, European robins, Chaffinches, and house sparrows.
- The blue tit (Parus caeruleus) is specifically mentioned in the context of being startled by eyespots, indicating its involvement in the experiment.
- The starling (Sturnus vulgaris) is mentioned as a model for understanding avian visual perception, but it is not explicitly stated as a predator in the experiments.
- The paper does not specify that these birds were used in the experiments on the effects of conspicuous wing patterns such as eye-spots, but they are mentioned as predators in the area and in relation to visual perception studies."
Significance of butterfly eyespots as an anti-predator device in ground-based and aerial attacks,"Anne Lyytinen, Paul M Brakefield, Johanna Mappes",-,-,,93,2003,Lyytinen_2003.pdf,Ficedula hypoleuca,"  - ""We used two model predators: lizards (Anolis carolinensis) and pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) that are visually hunting insectivorous predators.""
  - ""Pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) are small passerine birds that feed on insects and other arthropods catching them in the air, from foliage, or from the ground.""
  - ""We trapped the birds in Konnevesi, Central Finland and put them into illuminated cages (65 × 80× 65 cm) where they were maintained on the diet of mealworms and water ad libitum.""
  - ""The experiment was conducted in June 2001 at the Konnevesi Research Station. After the experiments, we released all birds.""
  - ""Eyespots did not lead to a higher probability of escape of butterflies from the birds once captured (Wilcoxon signed-rank test: z = -0.632, p =0.527, n = 21).""
  - ""Pied flycatchers (n =21) attacked equally often the wings in both butterfly forms (8 and 8, respectively; with in five cases the bird blocking the view of the observer, Table 2""
  - ""Birds preferred the wings to the body as a target for an attack independently of whether wings possessed eyespots or not (t-test: t = 2.236, p = 0.041, n =16, for both forms).""","  - ""(Page 4, Table 2) | Butterfly form | The fate                  | The target       | \n|----------------|---------------------------|------------------|\n|                | Eaten | Escaped with wing damage | Wings | The body |""","- The paper explicitly mentions the use of ""pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca)"" as one of the model predators in the experiment.
- The Latin binomial name ""Ficedula hypoleuca"" is consistently used throughout the paper to refer to the bird species used in the experiment.
- There is no mention of any other bird species being used in the experiment, so only ""Ficedula hypoleuca"" is relevant to the question."
The Feeding Behaviour of Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) in the Presence of 'Eyes',"I R Inglis, L W Huson, M B Marshall, P A Arid,  Neville",-,-,-,-,-,Inglis_1983.pdf,Sturnus vulgaris,"  - ""The starling (Sturnus vulgaris) was the subject species.""
  - ""The subjects were eight adult starlings randomly selected from the central pool of wild caught birds.""
  - ""The subjects were eight adult starlings randomly selected from the pool of wild caught birds.""",,"- The paper explicitly states that the subject species used in the experiments was the starling.
- The Latin binomial name for the starling is provided as ""Sturnus vulgaris.""
- There is no mention of any other bird species being used in the experiments related to the effects of eye-like patterns."
The position of eyespots and thickened segments influence their protective value to caterpillars,"John Skelhorn, Giles Dorrington, Thomas J Hossie, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,,16,2014,Skelhorn_2014.pdf,Gallus gallus domesticus,"  - ""To differentiate between these contrasting explanations, we evaluated the responses of naive chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus) to artificial caterpillar-like prey.""
  - ""Fifty-nine newly hatched domestic chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus) of the ""Ross"" strain were purchased from a commercial hatchery in Berwickshire, UK.""",,"- The paper explicitly mentions the use of ""naive chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus)"" in the experiments.
- The species name ""Gallus gallus domesticus"" is provided, which is the Latin binomial name for domestic chickens.
- The paper does not mention any other bird species being used in the experiment."
"The protective value of conspicuous signals is not impaired by shape, size, or position asymmetry","Martin Stevens, Sarah A Castor-Perry, Jessica R F Price",-,-,,19,2009,Stevens&CastorPerry_2009.pdf,none,"  - ""The experiment followed the same overall procedure as Stevens et al. (2007) and Stevens, Hardman, and Stubbins (2008)""
  - ""The woodland has a range of avian predators, primarily small songbirds (see Stevens, Hardman, and Stubbins 2008)""",,"- The paper mentions that the experiment was conducted in a woodland with a range of avian predators, primarily small songbirds. However, it does not specify the exact species of birds involved in the experiment.
- The references to other studies by Stevens et al. (2007) and Stevens, Hardman, and Stubbins (2008) suggest that these studies might provide more specific information about the bird species, but this information is not included in the provided text.
- Since the paper does not specify the Latin binomial name of any bird species used in the experiment, the answer should reflect this lack of information."
