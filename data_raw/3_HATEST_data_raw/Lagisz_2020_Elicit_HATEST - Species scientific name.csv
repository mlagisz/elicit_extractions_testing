Can the way pigs are handled alter behavioural and physiological measures of affective state?,"Ricard Carreras, Laura Arroyo, Eva Mainau, Daniel Valent, Anna Bassols, Antoni Dalmau, Luigi Faucitano, Xavier Manteca, Antonio Velarde",-,-,Behavioural Processes,16,2017,Carreras2017.pdf,Sus scrofa,"  - ""In this study, 56 female pigs ((Landrace x Large White) x Piétrain) were used.""",,"- The paper explicitly mentions the use of ""56 female pigs ((Landrace x Large White) x Piétrain)"" in the study.
- The scientific name for pigs is Sus scrofa, but the paper does not provide this information directly. However, the breed names ""Landrace x Large White"" and ""Piétrain"" are indicative of domestic pigs, which are a subspecies of Sus scrofa.
- Since the paper does not provide the full scientific name, we must infer it based on the context that the subjects are domestic pigs."
"Does stocking density modify affective state in pigs as assessed by cognitive bias, behavioural and physiological parameters?","Annalisa Scollo, Flaviana Gottardo, Barbara Contiero, Sandra A Edwards",-,-,,62,2014,Scollo2014.pdf,Sus scrofa,"  - ""A total of 40 entire male and female crossbred pigs (Large White × Landrace), which had previously experienced the same housing and management conditions, were selected at approximately 14 weeks of age and 45 kg live weight.""",,"- The paper mentions that the study involved ""40 entire male and female crossbred pigs (Large White × Landrace).""
- The scientific name for pigs is not explicitly mentioned in the paper, but the breed names ""Large White"" and ""Landrace"" are provided.
- The scientific name for pigs is generally accepted as Sus scrofa, which is not explicitly mentioned in the paper but is the standard scientific name for domestic pigs."
Effect of gender and halothane genotype on cognitive bias and its relationship with fear in pigs,"Ricard Carreras, Laura Arroyo, Eva Mainau, Raquel Pe Ña, Anna Bassols, Antoni Dalmau, Luigi Faucitano, Xavier Manteca, Antonio Velarde",-,-,,17,2016,Carreras2016.pdf,Sus scrofa,"  - ""In this study, 48 crossbred pigs (Landrace × Large White sows sired with Piétrain boars) were divided into four groups of 12 pigs each.""",,"- The paper mentions that the study involved ""48 crossbred pigs (Landrace × Large White sows sired with Piétrain boars),"" which indicates the species used in the experiment.
- The scientific name for pigs is Sus scrofa."
"Effects of Cage Enrichment on Behavior, Welfare and Outcome Variability in Female Mice","Jeremy D Bailoo, Eimear Murphy, Maria Boada-Saña, Justin A Varholick, Sara Hintze, Caroline Baussière, Kerstin C Hahn, Christine Göpfert, Rupert Palme, Bernhard Voelkl, Hanno Würbel",-,-,Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience,85,2018,Bailoo_2018.pdf,Mus musculus,"  - ""The mouse, Mus musculus, is the most widely used animal in research, and yet surprisingly little is known about how its behavioral biology relates to the social and physical aspects of current laboratory housing conditions (Latham and Mason, 2004).""
  - ""We used a 4 (cage enrichment) × 2 (mouse strain) factorial design conducted in two consecutive batches of equal size; the second batch began 3 weeks after the end of the first batch. Subjects were 192 female mice, 96 each of the inbred strain C57BL/6JRj (C57) and the outbred strain RjOrl:SWISS (SWISS) from Janvier Labs, France.""",,"- The paper explicitly mentions ""The mouse, Mus musculus"" as the species used in the research.
- The scientific name ""Mus musculus"" is a standard way to refer to the common mouse in scientific literature.
- The paper also specifies that the study involved ""192 female mice, 96 each of the inbred strain C57BL/6JRj (C57) and the outbred strain RjOrl:SWISS (SWISS),"" which are strains of Mus musculus."
Frontal brain deactivation during a non-verbal cognitive judgement bias test in sheep,"Kathrin Guldimann, Sabine Vögeli, Martin Wolf, Beat Wechsler, Lorenz Gygax",-,-,Brain and Cognition,20,2015,Guldimann2015.pdf,Ovis aries,"  - ""24 focal sheep (12 from each housing group) that had previously been chosen at random were included in the cognitive judgement bias test.""
  - ""Twenty-nine female non-lactating and non-gestating Lacaune sheep about 2.5 years of age made up the two groups used in this experiment (Vögeli et al., 2014).""",,"- The paper explicitly mentions that the experiment involved ""Lacaune sheep,"" which is a breed of sheep.
- The scientific name for sheep is ""Ovis aries,"" and Lacaune is a specific breed within this species.
- The paper does not provide the full scientific name, but based on the context, it is clear that the species being referred to is sheep, which is scientifically known as ""Ovis aries."""
"Measurement of cognitive bias and cortisol levels to evaluate the effects of space restriction on captive collared peccary (Mammalia, Tayassuidae)","Flávia R M Oliveira, Sérgio L G Nogueira-Filho, Maria B C Sousa, Carlos T S Dias, Michael Mendl, Selene S C Nogueira",-,-,,11,2016,Oliveira2016.pdf,Pecari tajacu,"  - ""We carried out an experiment with six adult male collared peccaries (Pecari tajacu) at the Laboratório de Etologia Aplicada, Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruz, Brazil""
  - ""We use the judgement-bias paradigm to evaluate whether space restriction in metabolism pens affects the emotional state of collared peccary (Pecari tajacu) during a nutritional experiment.""",,"- The paper explicitly mentions the species being studied as ""collared peccary (Pecari tajacu)"" in multiple places.
- The scientific name ""Pecari tajacu"" is consistently used to refer to the species throughout the paper."
The effects of housing conditions on judgement bias in Japanese quail,"Mária Horváth, Katarína Pichová, L ' Ubor Košt'ál",-,-,,12,2016,Horvàth2016.pdf,Coturnix japonica,"  - ""Female Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) were hatched and reared at the Institute of Animal Biochemistry and Genetics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Ivanka pri Dunaji, Slovak Republic.""",,"- The paper explicitly mentions the species used in the experiment as ""Japanese quail"" with the scientific name ""Coturnix japonica.""
- This information is provided in the context of describing the animals used in the study, indicating that ""Coturnix japonica"" is the species scientific name."
Validation of a novel cognitive bias task based on difference in quantity of reinforcement for assessing environmental enrichment,"Heidi A Keen, O Lynne Nelson, Charles T Robbins, Marc Evans, David J Shepherdson, Ruth C Newberry",-,-,-,-,-,Keen2014.pdf,Ursus arctos horribilis,"  - ""We explored the use of our novel cognitive bias task with captive grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis).""
  - ""Eight adult grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) from the Washington State University Bear Research, Education, and Conservation Center participated in this study.""
  - ""We hypothesized that a novel cognitive bias task based on positive reinforcement using quantity differences would detect changes in affect in captive grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis).""",,"- The paper explicitly mentions the species used in the experiment as ""grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis)"" multiple times.
- The scientific name ""Ursus arctos horribilis"" is consistently used to refer to the species of bears involved in the study.
