  - ""Nicotine was also administered for comparison.""",,"- The paper explicitly states that the primary pesticide investigated is imidacloprid, which is a neonicotinoid pesticide.
- Nicotine is mentioned as a compound used for comparison, but it is not a pesticide; it is used as a reference due to its similar action on nicotinic receptors.
- The study focuses on the effects of imidacloprid on zebrafish, indicating that it is the primary pesticide being tested."
