Artificial light at night affects brain plasticity and melatonin in birds,"Stan Moaraf, Yulia Vistoropsky, Tatyana Pozner, Rachel Heiblum, Monika Okuliarová, Michal Zeman, Anat Barnea",-,-,Neuroscience Letters,47,2019,Moaraf_2019.pdf,"The main data source for the melatonin values is Figure 5 in the paper, which summarizes the results of the radioimmunoassay measurements taken at midday and midnight.","  - ""We measured MEL plasma concentrations during midday and during the nights before and during exposure to ALAN, and the results are summarized in Fig. 5""
  - ""Four blood samples were taken from each bird (Fig. 5 ): at midday on day 1 of week 3 of acclimation, at day 1 of week 3 of the ALAN period; and two at midnight, three days after each of the midday samples. Blood collection at midnight was performed under a dim red light.""
  - ""Plasma MEL concentrations were measured by direct radioimmunoassay [41], which has been validated for zebra finches [42].""",,"
To determine the data source for the melatonin data, I will look for the section of the paper that provides the most detailed reporting of the melatonin values. 

The paper states:
""We measured MEL plasma concentrations during midday and during the nights before and during exposure to ALAN, and the results are summarized in Fig. 5.""
This indicates that the melatonin data is presented in Figure 5 of the paper.

The paper also provides more details on the melatonin measurements:
""Four blood samples were taken from each bird (Fig. 5 ): at midday on day 1 of week 3 of acclimation, at day 1 of week 3 of the ALAN period; and two at midnight, three days after each of the midday samples. Blood collection at midnight was performed under a dim red light.""
This provides the specific details on when the melatonin samples were collected.

The paper further states:
""Plasma MEL concentrations were measured by direct radioimmunoassay [41], which has been validated for zebra finches [42].""
This indicates that the melatonin data comes from the radioimmunoassay measurements described.

Therefore, the main data source for the melatonin values is Figure 5 in the paper, which summarizes the results of the radioimmunoassay measurements taken at midday and midnight.
