Can the way pigs are handled alter behavioural and physiological measures of affective state?,"Ricard Carreras, Laura Arroyo, Eva Mainau, Daniel Valent, Anna Bassols, Antoni Dalmau, Luigi Faucitano, Xavier Manteca, Antonio Velarde",-,-,Behavioural Processes,16,2017,Carreras2017.pdf,1,"  - ""At the end of the reminder sessions, each pig was individually subjected to the CBT where a bucket containing two pieces of chopped apple that were accessible by the pig was placed in the middle of the pen.""",,"
The paper does not explicitly state the ""Number of ambiguous cues"" used in the cognitive bias test. However, it does provide details on the setup of the cognitive bias test:
""At the end of the reminder sessions, each pig was individually subjected to the CBT where a bucket containing two pieces of chopped apple that were accessible by the pig was placed in the middle of the pen.""
This indicates that there was only a single ambiguous cue used - the bucket containing the chopped apples. The paper does not mention any other ambiguous cues being used in the cognitive bias test.

"Does stocking density modify affective state in pigs as assessed by cognitive bias, behavioural and physiological parameters?","Annalisa Scollo, Flaviana Gottardo, Barbara Contiero, Sandra A Edwards",-,-,,61,2014,Scollo2014.pdf,3,"  - ""During the testing days, the animals of the tested batch were individually exposed once per day to each of the three ambiguous probe locations (near rewarded: NR; middle: M; near unrewarded: NU), spread within a pseudorandom sequence of the two reference locations.""",,"
The paper states that during the testing phase, the animals were exposed to three ambiguous probe locations:
""During the testing days, the animals of the tested batch were individually exposed once per day to each of the three ambiguous probe locations (near rewarded: NR; middle: M; near unrewarded: NU), spread within a pseudorandom sequence of the two reference locations.""
The paper clearly specifies that there were three different ambiguous probe locations used in the judgement bias trials.

Effect of gender and halothane genotype on cognitive bias and its relationship with fear in pigs,"Ricard Carreras, Laura Arroyo, Eva Mainau, Raquel Pe Ña, Anna Bassols, Antoni Dalmau, Luigi Faucitano, Xavier Manteca, Antonio Velarde",-,-,,17,2016,Carreras2016.pdf,1,"  - ""The latency to contact the bucket, defined as the time pigs took from entering the test pen to the contact with the bucket, was recorded in all sessions.""
  - ""After the reminder sessions, each pig was individually subjected to a CBT that finished when the pig ate the chopped apples or 90 s after the pig had entered the test pen.""",,"
The paper does not explicitly state the ""Number of ambiguous cues"" used in the cognitive bias test. However, based on the description of the methodology, it appears that only one ambiguous cue was used:
""After the reminder sessions, each pig was individually subjected to a CBT that finished when the pig ate the chopped apples or 90 s after the pig had entered the test pen.""
The paper mentions that pigs were trained to discriminate between a positive cue (access to chopped apples) and a negative cue (no access to chopped apples). During the cognitive bias test, the ambiguous cue appears to be the presence of the bucket, which was neither the positive nor the negative cue.
""The latency to contact the bucket, defined as the time pigs took from entering the test pen to the contact with the bucket, was recorded in all sessions.""
The paper does not indicate that multiple ambiguous cues were used during the cognitive bias test.

"Effects of Cage Enrichment on Behavior, Welfare and Outcome Variability in Female Mice","Jeremy D Bailoo, Eimear Murphy, Maria Boada-Saña, Justin A Varholick, Sara Hintze, Caroline Baussière, Kerstin C Hahn, Christine Göpfert, Rupert Palme, Bernhard Voelkl, Hanno Würbel",-,-,Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience,84,2018,Bailoo_2018.pdf,3,"  - ""Once animals had learned this discrimination, ambiguous test trials with open goal-holes at three equidistant intermediate locations between the extreme ends, were interspersed among Go and No-Go trials, across six test sessions.""",,"
To determine the number of ambiguous cues used in the judgment bias task, I will look for relevant quotes in the paper that describe the task setup.


""To assess judgment biases, we developed a task which integrates active trial initiation into a spatial Go/No Go task (see Supplementary Figure S6 ). Each apparatus consisted of a rectangular arena with a row of nine goal-holes at one end (five of which were used for this task), and a trapezoid-shaped area containing a nosepoke at the opposite end.""
This quote indicates that the task used a row of 9 goal-holes, of which 5 were used.



""Once animals had learned this discrimination, ambiguous test trials with open goal-holes at three equidistant intermediate locations between the extreme ends, were interspersed among Go and No-Go trials, across six test sessions.""
This quote directly states that there were 3 ambiguous cue locations used in the judgment bias task.

The quotes from the paper clearly state that the judgment bias task used 3 ambiguous cue locations between the rewarded and non-rewarded locations. No additional quotes are needed to fully support this answer.

The paper states that in the test phase, in addition to the negatively and positively reinforced box locations in each corner of the testing area, ""three ambiguous locations were presented."" This indicates that the number of different ambiguous cues used in the judgement bias trials was 3.

"Measurement of cognitive bias and cortisol levels to evaluate the effects of space restriction on captive collared peccary (Mammalia, Tayassuidae)","Flávia R M Oliveira, Sérgio L G Nogueira-Filho, Maria B C Sousa, Carlos T S Dias, Michael Mendl, Selene S C Nogueira",-,-,,11,2016,Oliveira2016.pdf,1,"  - ""Given the absence of a suitable tone generator at the research site, and the success of this approach in training a closely-related wild species on the task, we used the same approach here with collared peccary.""
  - ""In judgement bias tests a 3 s 'ambiguous' auditory cue -a drumstick hitting an aluminum plate, CS A (Freq average 6 kHz; 62.8 dB) was presented to the animals.""",,"
The paper states that the researchers used a single ""ambiguous"" auditory cue during the judgement bias trials:
""In judgement bias tests a 3 s 'ambiguous' auditory cue -a drumstick hitting an aluminum plate, CS A (Freq average 6 kHz; 62.8 dB) was presented to the animals.""
The paper does not mention using any other ambiguous cues besides this single CS A cue. The researchers specifically state that they used categorically distinct sounds (whistle, horn, and bell) as the positive, negative, and ambiguous cues, rather than a graded series of tones.
""Given the absence of a suitable tone generator at the research site, and the success of this approach in training a closely-related wild species on the task, we used the same approach here with collared peccary.""

The paper states that in the judgement bias tests, in addition to the two cues used in discrimination training (positive and negative), the hens were exposed to three ambiguous cues:

The paper states that there were three intermediate shades of gray used as the ambiguous probe stimuli in the cognitive bias task:
""Five, 20.3 cm 9 20.3 cm paper squares were shaded at 20, 35, 50, 65, and 80 % gray, respectively, using a basic word-processing program.

The paper also mentions that each of the three intermediate probe cues was presented once per cognitive bias test session:
""Cognitive bias test sessions consisted of 30 trials, with one of the three intermediate shades of gray interjected in every ten trials according to a predetermined pseudo-randomization such that each intermediate cue was seen only once per session.""
Therefore, the number of ambiguous cues used in the cognitive bias task was 3.
