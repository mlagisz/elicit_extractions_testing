The paper explicitly states the types of light sources used in the experiment:
""For the three following weeks the birds were kept either in darkness during the night (the control group); or under three ALAN intensities: 5, 1.5 and 0.5 lx. These intensities were achieved by positioning the same small fluorescent lamp (CFL, Wälter, China), which emitted a full wavelength spectrum, at different distances from the birds.""
The paper clearly indicates that the light source used in the experiment was a fluorescent lamp. There is no mention of any other types of light sources such as LED, incandescent, halogen, or streetlights.

Can skyglow reduce nocturnal melatonin concentrations in Eurasian perch? *,"Franziska Kupprat, Franz H € Olker, Werner Kloas, Sarah Harmon",-,-,Environmental Pollution,38,2020,Kupprat_2020.pdf,fluorescent lamp,"  - ""Specifications on the spectrum and physical properties of the lamps have been described in an earlier publication using the same setup (Franke et al., 2013) and can be used for conversion to irradiance units (1 lx z 3.7 mW m À2""",,"
The paper states that the light sources used in the experiment were fluorescent tubes:
""Twelve equal aquaria with 80 L tap water were set up in a climate chamber at ca. 17 C (see below for more details). Each aquarium was equipped with four fluorescent tubes (Biolux, Osram, Munich, Germany) of which three realized daylight with average intensities of 2900 lx on the water surface (measured at 25 equally distributed points on the water surface) and up to 7000 lx at the brightest spot. The fourth fluorescent tube realized experimental nocturnal illumination.""
The paper also mentions that the spectral properties of the lamps have been described in a previous publication using the same setup:
""Specifications on the spectrum and physical properties of the lamps have been described in an earlier publication using the same setup (Franke et al., 2013) and can be used for conversion to irradiance units (1 lx z 3.7 mW m À2 ).""

To determine the light sources used in the Herbert Underwood paper, I will look for relevant quotes that mention the types of lamps or light sources used in the experiments.

The paper does not explicitly mention the specific light sources used in the experiments. However, it does provide some relevant details about the lighting conditions:

""Nighttime samples were taken using a dim red light (maximum intensity 10 lx).""
This quote indicates that a dim red light was used for nighttime sampling, but does not specify the type of light source.

""Commencing at 18:00 hr on March 30, the lizards were released into LL (2000 lx) and sampled for blood 3 days later commencing at 08:00 hr on April 1.""
This quote mentions that the lizards were exposed to ""LL"" (constant light) with an intensity of 2000 lx, but again does not specify the type of light source.

""Experiments were conducted in the austral spring to autumn (November to May).""
This quote suggests the experiments were conducted in a natural lighting environment, rather than using artificial lighting.

Based on the information provided in the paper, the light sources used are not explicitly stated. The paper mentions the use of a dim red light for nighttime sampling and a constant light condition, but does not specify the type of light sources (e.g. LED, fluorescent, incandescent, etc.). Therefore, the most appropriate answer is ""unclear/other"".
