Association between maternal exposure to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances and risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Zhuoma Deji, Peng Liu, Xin Wang, Xin Zhang, Yuehua Luo, Zhenzhen Huang",-,-,Science of the Total Environment,39,2021,Deji_2021.pdf,multiple,,,"
The paper focuses on multiple types of PFAS substances in its evidence synthesis and meta-analysis. This is evident from the following quotes:
Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and their derivatives are a class of persistent organic pollutants containing a hydrophobic chain fully or partially saturated with fluorine atoms.
There are sixteen, sixteen, eight and eight studies that assessed the relationship between maternal PFOA, PFOS, PFNA and PFHxS exposure and preterm birth, respectively.
The combined results suggested a positive relationship between maternal exposure to PFOS and the risk of preterm birth.
No associations were found between maternal PFOA (pooled OR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.89, 1.08; I 2 = 54.6%, p = 0.005) (Fig. 5B ), PFNA (pooled OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 0.89, 1.18; I 2 = 36.3%, p = 0.139) (Fig. 5C ), PFHxS (pooled OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.85, 1.09; I 2 = 20.9%, p = 0.263) (Fig. 5D ) concentrations and preterm birth.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANT EXPOSURES AND PRETERM BIRTH: A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW,"Kelly K Ferguson, Marie S O'neill, John D Meeker",-,-,"Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health. Part B, Critical Reviews",145,2013,Ferguson_2013.pdf,multiple,,,"
The review focuses on two main types of PFAS chemicals in terms of evidence synthesis: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS). This is evident from the following quotes:
Perfluorinated chemicals repel oil, grease, and water and are used to treat carpets and clothing to prevent stains, and are also components of some food containers and wrappers (ATSDR, 2009) . Through product use and manufacturing they can be released into the environment, and do not degrade in soil or water. Exposure occurs through consumption of contaminated drinking water and food, inadvertent ingestion of indoor dust, and potentially through inhalation (ATSDR, 2009) . The two compounds produced in largest quantities include perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS).
Several recent studies examined the relationship between PFOA and PFOS exposure and preterm birth.
Four studies examined associations in populations where exposure levels were relatively low and on the same order of magnitude as those observed in the general U.S. population. Apelberg et al. (2007) measured PFOA and PFOS levels in cord serum from newborns in the Baltimore THREE study, where a relatively high proportion of births were preterm (n = 293, preterm = 28). No significant differences in median concentrations were detected, however, in term compared to preterm samples.

The review focuses on multiple types of PFAS substances, with a particular emphasis on long-chain PFAS such as PFOA and PFOS. This is evident from the following quotes:

""Exposure was defined as exposure to PFOA, PFNA, PFDA, PFUnDA, PFDoDA, perfluorotridecanoic acid (PFTrDA), perfluorotetradecanoic acid (PFTeDA), perfluorohexadecanoic acid (PFHxDA), PFOS, PFHpS, PFHxS, perfluorodecane sulfonic acid (PFDS), pentafluorobenzoic acid (PFBA), perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA), perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS), perfluorooctane sulfonamide (PFOSA), N-ethyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamidoacetic acid (Et-PFOSA-AcOH), or N-methyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamidoacetic acid (Me-PFOSA-AcOH).""

Legacy and emerging pollutants in Latin America: A critical review of occurrence and levels in environmental and food samples,"Cristina Marília,  Oliveira Souza, Bruno Alves Rocha, Joseph A Adeyemi, Martí Nadal, José Luis Domingo, Fernando Barbosa, Damià Barceló",-,-,Science of the Total Environment,51,2022,Souza_2022.pdf,multiple,"  - ""There are still gaps in Latin America's PFAS, EDCs, and illicit drug studies.""",,"
The paper does not provide any specific information about the types of PFAS chemicals that were the focus of the review. The paper states:
""There are still gaps in Latin America's PFAS, EDCs, and illicit drug studies.""
This indicates that PFAS were one of the groups of emerging pollutants that the review aimed to cover, but it does not specify whether the review focused on one particular PFAS chemical or multiple PFAS chemicals. The paper does not provide any further details about the PFAS chemicals that were included in the review.

The review focuses on multiple types of PFAS substances, not just one. This is evident from the following quotes:

""Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are widely used synthetic aliphatic compounds. This systematic review aims to assess PFAS associations with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), total cholesterol (TC) and total triglyceride (TG) concentrations in human populations.""
The review explicitly states that it aims to assess associations between PFAS and various lipid concentrations, indicating that it covers multiple PFAS substances.

""We categorised populations into adults (≥18 years old) and children. Primary findings were the associations between PFAS concentrations and LDL, HDL, TC, and TG concentrations in the serum, plasma, or whole blood; secondary findings were the associations between PFAS concentrations and the odds of lipid-related health outcomes.""
This quote further confirms that the review examines the associations between PFAS concentrations (plural) and various lipid measures.

""We took reference from the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement throughout the process (Liberati et al., 2009).""

The paper discusses the evidence for the association between ADHD and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), which are a group of chemicals. The paper states:
""Two studies on perfluoroalkyl compounds (PFCs) (i.e., PFASs) during childhood and ADHD were included in a review by Nilsen and Tulve (2020) [18]. The results were somewhat discordant: One study reported no significant relationship between increasing PFC exposures and ADHD outcomes in children aged 6-12 years but observed a sex-based relationship.

""Five studies in which exposure was assessed either before birth or during childhood were identified in another review with a broader outcome definition [47]. Several, but not all, studies suggested a positive association between prenatal exposure to PFCs and ADHD or related behavioral problems.""
The paper does not focus on a single PFAS chemical, but rather discusses the evidence for the broader group of PFASs or PFCs. Therefore, the answer is that the review focuses on multiple PFAS substances.
