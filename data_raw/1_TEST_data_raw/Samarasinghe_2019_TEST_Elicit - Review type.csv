Built environmental correlates of older adults' total physical activity and walking: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"David W Barnett, Anthony Barnett, Andrea Nathan, Jelle Van Cauwenberg, Ester Cerin",-,-,-,-,-,Barnett_2017.pdf,"systematic review, meta-analysis","  - ""systematic review and meta-analysis""
  - ""This systematic review and meta-analysis was registered in PROSPERO (Registration no. CRD42016051227 [38]) in November 2016.""
  - ""Due to the large range of different environmental and PA measures reported in the selected articles, it was not possible to conduct a 'traditional' meta-analysis involving the estimation of pooled effect sizes and their 95% confidence intervals. Hence, to quantitatively synthesise the findings, a meta-analytic approach was applied to define conservative estimates of p-values for each examined combination of environmental attribute and PA outcome [27].""

The paper clearly states that it is a systematic review and meta-analysis, as it registered the review in PROSPERO and applied a meta-analytic approach to synthesize the findings.

The paper states that it is a ""systematic review of the economic analysis of the health impacts of housing improvement studies"":
""This paper presents the results of this review, providing details of the cost and economic analyses reported alongside housing intervention studies and accompanying health impacts.""
""All housing intervention studies and their associated papers included in the 2009 systematic review of the health impacts of housing improvement 14 were examined for reports of costs and economic analyses.""
The paper also mentions that a separate search for economic studies was not undertaken, but economic studies which included health outcomes following housing improvement would have been identified in the broad search:
""A separate search for economic studies was not undertaken but economic studies which included health outcomes following housing improvement would have been identified in the broad search.""
Based on this, the review type is a systematic review, as the authors systematically reviewed the existing literature on the health impacts of housing improvement studies that also reported cost and economic analyses.
