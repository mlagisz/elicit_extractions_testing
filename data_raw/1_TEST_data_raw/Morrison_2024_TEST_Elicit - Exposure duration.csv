The paper states that the adult zebrafish were exposed to different concentrations of cypermethrin for 30 minutes:
""For the screening of effective dose of cypermethrin which can be used for the induction of behavioural abnormalities upon short exposure, adult zebrafish in a group of five fishes per treatment were exposed for 30 min to different test concentrations of cypermethrin viz. 0 μg/L (0 ppb) (used as control), or 0.25 μg/L (0.25 ppb), 2.5 μg/L (2.5 ppb) and 25 μg/L (25 ppb) concentration of cypermethrin.""
""Briefly, adult zebrafish of mixed gender were randomly selected from their housing tank and gently transferred to two tanks viz. the control tank containing no cypermethrin and the treatment tank containing 25 μg/L of cypermethrin as final concentration. Fishes were exposed for 30 min in their respective treatment tanks and then individually transferred to the behavioural imaging setup as described earlier (Nema et al., 2016).""
