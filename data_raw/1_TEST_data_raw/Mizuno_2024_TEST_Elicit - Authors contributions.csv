The position of eyespots and thickened segments influence their protective value to caterpillars,"John Skelhorn, Giles Dorrington, Thomas J Hossie, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,,15,2014,Skelhorn_2014.pdf,no,"  - ""All experiments were conducted by J.S. and G.D.

The paper does not contain a section explicitly describing the authors' contributions. There is no mention of the specific roles or contributions of each author in the study. The closest the paper comes to describing the authors' contributions is in the acknowledgements section, which states:

""All experiments were conducted by J.S. and G.D. T.J.H. and T.N.S. conceived the study, designed the experiments, and wrote the manuscript.""

However, this does not provide a detailed breakdown of the specific contributions of each author. The paper lacks a dedicated ""Authors Contributions"" section that would typically outline the roles and responsibilities of each author.
