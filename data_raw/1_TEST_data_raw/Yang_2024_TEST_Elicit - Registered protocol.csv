Can skyglow reduce nocturnal melatonin concentrations in Eurasian perch? *,"Franziska Kupprat, Franz H € Olker, Werner Kloas, Sarah Harmon",-,-,Environmental Pollution,38,2020,Kupprat_2020.pdf,no,"  - ""The experiment was approved by the legal review of animal testing of the Berlin State Office of Health and Social Affairs (LAGeSo reference number G0055/16).""
  - ""The experiment was done according to the setup and procedure of Brüning et al. (2015). The light intensities were further dimmed down to 0.1 lx and 0.01 lx by partially covering the light source with tape and neutral density filter foil. Everything else was replicated with great care to ensure comparability of the results.""
  - ""Thirty fish were moved to each aquarium and allowed to acclimate for two weeks with bright days (around 2900 lx) and dark nights, i.e. non-detectable light intensities below 0.00167 lx with the used luxmeter (ILT1700, International Light Technologies, Peabody, MA, USA). During acclimation the flow-through with tap water was 12.4 ± 2.2 L h À1 and the fish were fed twice per day with frozen blood worms and the aquaria were cleaned once per day.""",,"
The paper does not mention a ""Registered protocol"" or any other formal protocol registration. There is no indication in the paper that the study was pre-registered or that a protocol was published prior to conducting the research.

However, the paper does provide a detailed description of the experimental methods and procedures used in the study:
""The experiment was approved by the legal review of animal testing of the Berlin State Office of Health and Social Affairs (LAGeSo reference number G0055/16).""
""The experiment was done according to the setup and procedure of Brüning et al. (2015).

  - ""All the experimental procedure was conducted in compliance with the ethical considerations recommended for biological rhythm research (Portaluppi et al. 2010)""",,"
The paper does not mention a ""Registered protocol"" or any information about a pre-registered study design. There are no quotes in the paper that indicate the study had a pre-registered protocol.

The paper does, however, provide information about the roles and contributions of the study authors. In the abstract, it states:
""The present study, we examined the behavioral and biochemical changes induced by continuous light and continuous darkness exposure in a diurnal and a nocturnal rodent.""
This suggests that all four authors were involved in designing and conducting the study.
Additionally, the paper states:
""All the experimental procedure was conducted in compliance with the ethical considerations recommended for biological rhythm research (Portaluppi et al. 2010)""
This indicates that the authors followed established ethical guidelines in their research.
