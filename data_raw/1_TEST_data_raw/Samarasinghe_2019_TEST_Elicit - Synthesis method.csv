Built environmental correlates of older adults' total physical activity and walking: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"David W Barnett, Anthony Barnett, Andrea Nathan, Jelle Van Cauwenberg, Ester Cerin",-,-,-,-,-,Barnett_2017.pdf,quantitative,"  - ""Due to the large range of different environmental and PA measures reported in the selected articles, it was not possible to conduct a 'traditional' meta-analysis involving the estimation of pooled effect sizes and their 95% confidence intervals.

The paper describes using a meta-analytic approach to quantitatively synthesize the findings from the included studies. This is evident from the following quotes:

The paper also mentions that they conducted a sensitivity analysis to examine the influence of sample size and article quality on the meta-analytic findings.

Economic analysis of the health impacts of housing improvement studies: a systematic review,"Elisabeth Fenwick, Catriona Macdonald, Hilary Thomson",-,-,Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health,35,2013,Fenwick_2013.pdf,qualitative,"  - ""Forty-five studies were identified in the original review. The study designs varied and included five randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and 23 non-randomised controlled studies.

The paper does not describe a formal synthesis method for combining the evidence from the included studies. Instead, it appears to take a narrative approach to summarizing the cost and economic analysis data reported in the studies.

""Forty-five studies were identified in the original review. The study designs varied and included five randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and 23 non-randomised controlled studies. The better quality RCTs and controlled studies were used to draw conclusions about effectiveness.""
This quote indicates that the original review used the higher quality studies to draw conclusions about the health impacts of housing interventions, but does not describe how the economic data was synthesized.

""Studies which present cost data without economic evaluation were further examined for the potential to have conducted an economic evaluation, that is, presence of a suitable health outcome which could be linked to cost and compared to an alternative (table 1 ). Studies which reported having undertaken an economic evaluation (table 3 ) were examined to determine the precise form of that analysis (table 1 ).""
This quote describes how the authors categorized the included studies based on whether they reported cost data or claimed to have conducted an economic evaluation, but does not indicate that any statistical synthesis was performed.

""Findings from the studies which report costs only, suggest that fuel costs may reduce following provision of warmth and energy efficiency improvements, and that rents may increase following housing improvement. These findings need careful interpretation.""
This quote provides a narrative summary of the findings from the studies reporting cost data, but does not describe any quantitative synthesis of the results.

Impacts of heat waves and corresponding measures: a review,"Jian Zuo, Stephen Pullen, Jasmine Palmer, Helen Bennetts, Nicholas Chileshe, Tony Ma",-,-,,228,2015,Zuo_2015.pdf,qualitative,"  - ""The knowledge gap is identified as a result of which a future research agenda has been suggested.""

  - ""This paper reports on a critical literature review which covers the following main aspects: (1) the definition of heat waves; (2) the impacts of heat waves on health, ecosystems and the built environment;

The paper does not explicitly state the ""Synthesis method"" used. However, based on the information provided in the paper, it appears to be a qualitative review:

""This paper reports on a critical literature review which covers the following main aspects: (1) the definition of heat waves; (2) the impacts of heat waves on health, ecosystems and the built environment; (3) the current mechanisms to deal with impacts of heat waves.""
The paper does not mention any statistical synthesis of results from primary studies, such as meta-analysis or meta-regression. Instead, it provides a narrative summary of the existing literature on heat waves and their impacts.

""As a result, 173 papers and reports were selected to be critically reviewed in this study. Majority of these are sourced from international journals, conference proceedings and books (132); followed by reports from governmental authorities in Australia (19); reports from research institutes (12); and reports from international organizations (10).""
The paper synthesizes the evidence from these 173 sources in a qualitative manner, without any quantitative analysis of the results from primary studies.

""The knowledge gap is identified as a result of which a future research agenda has been suggested.""
The paper concludes by identifying knowledge gaps and suggesting future research directions, which is typical of a qualitative review.

Latent heat storage in building elements: A systematic review on properties and contextual performance factors,"A Mavrigiannaki, E Ampatzi",-,-,,76,2016,Mavrigiannaki_2016.pdf,qualitative,"  - ""the added value in systematic reviews is the transparency of the methodology used which allows reproducibility and thus creates a precedent for future reviews to build upon.""

The paper describes using a systematic review methodology, which involves a structured and transparent process for identifying, selecting, and synthesizing relevant literature. The authors state that they ""employed a systematic (structured) review procedure"" and that ""the added value in systematic reviews is the transparency of the methodology used which allows reproducibility and thus creates a precedent for future reviews to build upon.""
""A systematic review uses clearly defined search criteria that are justified by the scope and orientation of the research [21,26].""
