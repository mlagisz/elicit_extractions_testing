  - ""17 classes of compounds classified as legacy and emerging pollutants, from organic compounds to chemical elements.""",,"
The review paper by Cristina Marília, Oliveira Souza, Bruno Alves Rocha, Joseph A Adeyemi, Martí Nadal, José Luis Domingo, Fernando Barbosa, and Damià Barceló (2022) does not appear to be focused solely on PFAS. The abstract states:

""There are still gaps in Latin America's PFAS, EDCs, and illicit drug studies.""

This indicates that PFAS is one of several classes of emerging pollutants that the review covers, along with endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) and illicit drugs. The paper also states that it encompasses ""17 classes of compounds classified as legacy and emerging pollutants, from organic compounds to chemical elements.""

""This review encompasses 17 classes of compounds classified as legacy and emerging pollutants, from organic compounds to chemical elements.""

Therefore, the review does not appear to be focused solely on PFAS, but rather covers a broad range of legacy and emerging pollutants in the Latin American region.
