The paper does not mention the specific prey species used in the experiments. However, it does state that the study focused on hawkmoth caterpillars (family Sphingidae), specifically in the subfamily Macroglossinae:

""Curiously, within Sphingidae, larval eyespots seem to be restricted to Macroglossinae and are not observed in the related Smerinthinae and Sphinginae subfamilies.""

The paper also mentions the frangipani hornworm (Pseudosphinx tetrio) as an exception to the general relationship between body size and eyespots in hawkmoth caterpillars.

The paper does not mention the Latin binomial name of any prey species used in the experiments. Instead, the paper describes using ""artificial, triangular prey items"" that were made of printed paper and covered a reward, a small piece of peanut. There are no mentions of any real butterfly, moth, or other insect species being used as prey in the experiments.

The paper does not explicitly state the Latin binomial name of the prey species used in the experiment. However, the paper mentions that the artificial prey were ""modelled loosely on Papilio canadensis"" and that the experiments were conducted during the time when ""Canadian tiger swallowtail, Papilio canadensis, caterpillars could be found in the wild in our study area"". Additionally, the paper states that ""Papilio sp. caterpillars"" exhibit certain behaviors.

The paper does not mention any specific prey species that was used in the experiments. Instead, the authors used artificial ""moth-like stimuli"" that were not designed to mimic any real species. This is evident from the following quotes:

Significance of butterfly eyespots as an anti-predator device in ground-based and aerial attacks,"Anne Lyytinen, Paul M Brakefield, Johanna Mappes",-,-,,91,2003,Lyytinen_2003.pdf,Bicyclus anynana,"  - ""Bicyclus anynana (Satyrinae) shows variation in number, size, shape, colour composition, and position of eyespots (Brakefield and French 1999).""
  - ""To test the deflection hypothesis, we compared the survival of the spotless dry season form and spotted wet season form of Bicyclus anynana and examined the target of initial strike.""",,"
The paper clearly states that the prey species used in the experiments was Bicyclus anynana, a satyrine butterfly:
""Bicyclus anynana (Satyrinae) shows variation in number, size, shape, colour composition, and position of eyespots (Brakefield and French 1999).""
""To test the deflection hypothesis, we compared the survival of the spotless dry season form and spotted wet season form of Bicyclus anynana and examined the target of initial strike.""
""Furthermore, we used a double mutant line, Bigeye-comet, in which all the eyespots are larger in size than in the wet season form.""
The paper does not mention any other prey species being used in the experiments, so the prey species is solely Bicyclus anynana.

The Feeding Behaviour of Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) in the Presence of 'Eyes',"I R Inglis, L W Huson, M B Marshall, P A Arid,  Neville",-,-,-,-,-,Inglis_1983.pdf,Not mentioned (none),"  - ""If eyespots are aversive because they resemble predator eyes (POULTON 1980; BLEST 1957) , or indeed any vertebrate eye, then as Coss (1972) argued it would seem that the important recognition cues must include circularity of shape, pairedness and horizontal orientation; however the experimental evidence is certainly not conclusive.""

The paper does not mention any specific prey species that the eye-like patterns are meant to resemble. The paper focuses on the starling (Sturnus vulgaris) as the subject species, and discusses how eye-like patterns can deter starlings from feeding. There is no mention of any butterfly, moth, caterpillar or other prey species that the eye-like patterns are meant to mimic. The paper cites previous work by Blest that looked at eye-like patterns in the context of predation on insects like the butterfly Aglais urticae, but the current experiments do not involve any specific prey species.

The position of eyespots and thickened segments influence their protective value to caterpillars,"John Skelhorn, Giles Dorrington, Thomas J Hossie, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,,15,2014,Skelhorn_2014.pdf,Not mentioned (the latin binomial name of the prey species used in the experiments is not mentioned in the paper),"  - ""We followed Hossie and Sherratt's (2013) method of producing countershaded pastry caterpillars based loosely on the appearance of the late instars of Papilio canadensis and Papilio glaucus caterpillars.""

The paper does not explicitly state the Latin binomial name of the prey species used in the experiments. However, it does provide some details about the appearance of the artificial caterpillars used:
""We followed Hossie and Sherratt's (2013) method of producing countershaded pastry caterpillars based loosely on the appearance of the late instars of Papilio canadensis and Papilio glaucus caterpillars.""
This suggests that the artificial caterpillars were based on the appearance of Papilio canadensis and Papilio glaucus caterpillars, which are species of swallowtail butterflies. However, the paper does not state that these were the actual prey species used in the experiments.
""Countershaded prey with dark dorsal and light ventral sides (4 cm long with a diameter of ≈0.7 cm) was produced by pressing together dark and light pastry cylinders (4 cm long with a diameter of ≈0.5 cm).""
The paper describes the appearance of the artificial caterpillars used, but does not provide the Latin binomial names of the actual prey species.
