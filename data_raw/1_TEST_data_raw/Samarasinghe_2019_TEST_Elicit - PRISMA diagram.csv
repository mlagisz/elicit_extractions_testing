Economic analysis of the health impacts of housing improvement studies: a systematic review,"Elisabeth Fenwick, Catriona Macdonald, Hilary Thomson",-,-,Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health,35,2013,Fenwick_2013.pdf,no,"  - ""Forty-five studies were identified in the original review. The study designs varied and included five randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and 23 non-randomised controlled studies.""
  - ""All available data on costs and, where available, details of any economic analysis were extracted by one reviewer (CM) and checked by a second reviewer (EF or HT).""",,"
The paper does not appear to contain a PRISMA-like diagram illustrating the search and screening process for the studies included in the review. The paper states that ""All available data on costs and, where available, details of any economic analysis were extracted by one reviewer (CM) and checked by a second reviewer (EF or HT)."" However, it does not provide a visual diagram showing the flow of studies through the screening and selection process.

Impacts of heat waves and corresponding measures: a review,"Jian Zuo, Stephen Pullen, Jasmine Palmer, Helen Bennetts, Nicholas Chileshe, Tony Ma",-,-,,228,2015,Zuo_2015.pdf,no,"  - ""The aim of this research is to present a critical review of impacts of heat waves and corresponding mechanisms.

To determine if the paper includes a PRISMA-like diagram, I will carefully review the paper for any mention of such a diagram or a description of the literature search and screening process.

Latent heat storage in building elements: A systematic review on properties and contextual performance factors,"A Mavrigiannaki, E Ampatzi",-,-,,76,2016,Mavrigiannaki_2016.pdf,yes,"  - ""This methodology is applied here, not only to assure the comprehensiveness of the research, but also to guide the filtering of information identified.""
  - ""Fig. 1 depicts a summary of the search process.""",,"
The paper mentions a diagram that summarizes the search process, which appears to be a PRISMA-like diagram:
""Fig. 1 depicts a summary of the search process.""
The paper states that the systematic review used a well-established methodology from the health and social sciences, which typically involves a PRISMA-like diagram:
""This methodology is applied here, not only to assure the comprehensiveness of the research, but also to guide the filtering of information identified.""
The diagram in Fig. 1 shows the flow of the literature search and screening process, which is the typical purpose of a PRISMA-like diagram.

The paper does not mention or present a PRISMA diagram. The paper describes the systematic review process in detail, including the search strategy, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and number of studies identified and included. However, it does not provide a visual flow diagram illustrating this process, which is the key characteristic of a PRISMA diagram.

The paper provides a detailed description of the search and screening process, but does not present it visually in a PRISMA-like diagram. Therefore, the answer is:

No


The paper does not include a PRISMA-like diagram, but it does provide a thorough description of the search and screening process in the text. The quotes support that the authors did not present the process visually, but rather described it in detail. No additional quotes are needed to fully support the answer.
