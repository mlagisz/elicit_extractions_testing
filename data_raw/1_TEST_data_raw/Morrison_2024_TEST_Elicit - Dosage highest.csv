The paper states that the researchers tested several concentrations of cypermethrin to determine the effective dose for inducing behavioral toxicity in adult zebrafish:
""For the screening of effective dose of cypermethrin which can be used for the induction of behavioural abnormalities upon short exposure, adult zebrafish in a group of five fishes per treatment were exposed for 30 min to different test concentrations of cypermethrin viz. 0 μg/L (0 ppb) (used as control), or 0.25 μg/L (0.25 ppb), 2.5 μg/L (2.5 ppb) and 25 μg/L (25 ppb) concentration of cypermethrin.""
