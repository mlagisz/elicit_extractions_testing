Body size affects the evolution of eyespots in caterpillars,"Thomas John Hossie, John Skelhorn, Jesse W Breinholt, Akito Y Kawahara, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,49,2015,Hossie_2015.pdf,chick,"  - ""Seventy-two female domestic chicks of the Novogen Brown strain (Gallus gallus domesticus) were purchased from a commercial hatchery on the day of hatching. Sixty served as experimental chicks, and 12 served as buddies.""",,"
The paper does not mention the age of the birds used in the field experiments. However, it does provide details on the birds used in the laboratory experiments:
""Seventy-two female domestic chicks of the Novogen Brown strain (Gallus gallus domesticus) were purchased from a commercial hatchery on the day of hatching. Sixty served as experimental chicks, and 12 served as buddies.""
This quote clearly indicates that the birds used in the laboratory experiments were chicks, not adult birds.

Deflective effect and the effect of prey detectability on anti-predator function of eyespots,"Adrian Vallin, Marina Dimitrova, Ullasa Kodandaramaiah, Sami Merilaita, D Kemp",-,-,Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology,36,2011,Vallin_2011.pdf,adult,"  - ""The birds were ringed and released at the site of their capture after use in the present study. All the birds maintained their condition and were healthy upon release.""
  - ""We used wild caught blue tits, C. caeruleus, as predators, because they are insectivorous passerines and have been successfully used in previous predation experiments on butterflies and eyespots (e.g., Vallin et al. 2006Vallin et al. , 2007)).""",,"
The paper does not explicitly state the age of the blue tit predators used in the experiments. However, it does provide some relevant information:
""We used wild caught blue tits, C. caeruleus, as predators, because they are insectivorous passerines and have been successfully used in previous predation experiments on butterflies and eyespots (e.g., Vallin et al. 2006Vallin et al. , 2007).""
This suggests that the blue tits were wild-caught adults, as they had been used in previous predation experiments.
""The birds were ringed and released at the site of their capture after use in the present study. All the birds maintained their condition and were healthy upon release.""
This further indicates that the blue tits were adult birds, as they were able to be released back into the wild after the experiments.

Eyespots interact with body colour to protect caterpillar-like prey from avian predators,"Thomas John Hossie, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,Animal Behaviour,36,2012,Hossie_2012.pdf,NA,,,"
The paper does not mention the age of the birds involved in the experiments. There are no quotes that specify the age of the birds. The paper focuses on the effects of eyespots and countershading on artificial caterpillar prey, and does not provide any information about the age of the avian predators.

Field experiments on the effectiveness of 'eyespots' as predator deterrents,"Martin Stevens, Elinor Hopkins, William Hinde, Amabel Adcock, Yvonne Connolly, Tom Troscianko, Innes C Cuthill, K T Troscianko",-,-,-,-,-,Stevens_2007.pdf,NA,"  - ""Predation was determined by the disappearance of all or most of the mealworm from the target.""
  - ""The main avian predators in the area were blue tits, great tits, Parus major, European robins, Erithacus rubecula, Chaffinches, Fringilla coelebs, and house sparrows, Passer domesticus.""",,"
The paper does not mention the age of the birds used in the experiments. The experiments were conducted on wild birds in a nature reserve, and the main avian predators mentioned are blue tits, great tits, European robins, chaffinches, and house sparrows. However, the paper does not provide any information about the specific ages of these birds. 

""The main avian predators in the area were blue tits, great tits, Parus major, European robins, Erithacus rubecula, Chaffinches, Fringilla coelebs, and house sparrows, Passer domesticus.""
""Predation was determined by the disappearance of all or most of the mealworm from the target.""

Since the paper does not specify the ages of the birds, the most appropriate answer is ""NA"".

Significance of butterfly eyespots as an anti-predator device in ground-based and aerial attacks,"Anne Lyytinen, Paul M Brakefield, Johanna Mappes",-,-,,91,2003,Lyytinen_2003.pdf,NA,"  - ""We trapped the birds in Konnevesi, Central Finland and put them into illuminated cages (65 × 80× 65 cm) where they were maintained on the diet of mealworms and water ad libitum.""

The paper does not mention the age of the birds used in the experiments. The only information provided about the birds is that they were pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca), which are small passerine birds that feed on insects and other arthropods. The paper states that the birds were ""trapped in Konnevesi, Central Finland and put into illuminated cages (65 × 80× 65 cm) where they were maintained on the diet of mealworms and water ad libitum."" However, there is no information provided about the specific age of the birds used.

The paper does not explicitly state the age of the starling subjects used in the experiments. However, it does mention that the subjects were ""adult starlings randomly selected from a pool of birds that had been caught either at the local sewage works or on a Ministry of Agriculture experimental farm."" This indicates that the subjects were adult birds, not chicks or nestlings.

The position of eyespots and thickened segments influence their protective value to caterpillars,"John Skelhorn, Giles Dorrington, Thomas J Hossie, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,,15,2014,Skelhorn_2014.pdf,chick,"  - ""Fifty-nine newly hatched domestic chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus) of the ""Ross"" strain were purchased from a commercial hatchery in Berwickshire, UK.""

  - ""left to acclimatize to the laboratory for 1 h before being individually color marked""",,"
The paper explicitly states that the study used ""Fifty-nine newly hatched domestic chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus) of the ""Ross"" strain"" for the experiments. This indicates that the birds used were chicks, not adults or nestlings.
""Fifty-nine newly hatched domestic chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus) of the ""Ross"" strain were purchased from a commercial hatchery in Berwickshire, UK.""
The paper also mentions that the chicks were ""left to acclimatize to the laboratory for 1 h before being individually color marked"" on Day 1 posthatch, and that the experiments were conducted on Days 2-4 posthatch.
""On Day 1 posthatch, chicks were left to acclimatize to the laboratory for 1 h before being individually color marked (see previously).""
""On Day 2, 51 experimental chicks were trained to eat chick starter crumbs from the white paper-covered floor of an experimental arena.""
""On Day 4, the 27 birds that were to be the subjects of Experiment 1 were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 experimental groups (n = 9 per group).""
Based on this information, the birds used in the experiments were clearly chicks, not adults or nestlings.
