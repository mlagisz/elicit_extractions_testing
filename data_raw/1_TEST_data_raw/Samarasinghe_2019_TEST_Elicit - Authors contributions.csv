Economic analysis of the health impacts of housing improvement studies: a systematic review,"Elisabeth Fenwick, Catriona Macdonald, Hilary Thomson",-,-,Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health,35,2013,Fenwick_2013.pdf,yes,"  - ""Data were extracted from all studies included in the systematic review of housing improvement which had reported costs and economic analysis (n=29/45). The reported data were assessed for their suitability to economic evaluation. Where an economic analysis was reported the analysis was described according to pre-set definitions of various types of economic analysis used in the field of health economics.""
  - ""Two independent reviewers screened 27 082 citations to select the included studies. All available data on costs and, where available, details of any economic analysis were extracted by one reviewer (CM) and checked by a second reviewer (EF or HT).""",,"

""Michael Sanderson, Katherine Arbuthnott, Sari Kovats, Shakoor Hajat, Pete Falloon (2017)""
The paper does not contain any quotes or information about the authors' contributions.


No


The lack of an ""Author Contributions"" section in the paper indicates that the specific roles and contributions of the individual authors are not described. This is a common omission in review papers, where the focus is on summarizing the existing literature rather than detailing the specific work done by the authors of the review. Without any information about the authors' contributions, I can confidently conclude that the paper does not contain a description of the authors' roles.
