Can the way pigs are handled alter behavioural and physiological measures of affective state?,"Ricard Carreras, Laura Arroyo, Eva Mainau, Daniel Valent, Anna Bassols, Antoni Dalmau, Luigi Faucitano, Xavier Manteca, Antonio Velarde",-,-,Behavioural Processes,16,2017,Carreras2017.pdf,no,"  - ""The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of IRTA.""",,"
The paper does not mention a ""Registered protocol"" or any information about a registered study protocol. However, the paper does state that the ""The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of IRTA."" This suggests that the study procedures were reviewed and approved by an institutional animal care committee, but there is no mention of a pre-registered protocol.

""The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of IRTA.""

Additionally, the paper provides a detailed description of the study methods, including the treatments, behavioral tests, and sample collection procedures, indicating that the study was planned and conducted in a systematic way.
