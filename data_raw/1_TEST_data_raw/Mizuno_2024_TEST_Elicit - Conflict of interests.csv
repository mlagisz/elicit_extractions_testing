Deflective effect and the effect of prey detectability on anti-predator function of eyespots,"Adrian Vallin, Marina Dimitrova, Ullasa Kodandaramaiah, Sami Merilaita, D Kemp",-,-,Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology,36,2011,Vallin_2011.pdf,not declared specifically,"  - ""Here, we present a study on the anti-predation functions of eyespots, addressing two main topics, namely (a) deflective effect of eyespots and (b) the influence of prey detectability on deflective and deterring function of eyespots.""
  - ""The experimental protocol and housing of birds was reviewed and approved by the regional ethical committee in Linköping (Dnr: 62-08).""",,"
The paper does not mention any conflict of interests. There are no quotes that indicate the authors disclosed any potential conflicts of interest. The paper focuses on reporting the results of their experiments on the anti-predator functions of eyespots in prey.

""We used wild caught blue tits, C. caeruleus, as predators, because they are insectivorous passerines and have been successfully used in previous predation experiments on butterflies and eyespots (e.g., Vallin et al. 2006, 2007).""
""The experimental protocol and housing of birds was reviewed and approved by the regional ethical committee in Linköping (Dnr: 62-08).""

Eyespots interact with body colour to protect caterpillar-like prey from avian predators,"Thomas John Hossie, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,Animal Behaviour,36,2012,Hossie_2012.pdf,not declared specifically,"  - ""To determine whether constantly displayed eyespots were effective in deterring avian predation and/or deflecting strikes, we deployed artificial caterpillars in the field and monitored their 'survival'.""
  - ""Pastry caterpillars were designed to be fully palatable to birds, and our experimental design was approved by the Carleton University Research Ethics Committee (Protocol B10-14).""
  - ""Our experiment examined the protective value of eyespots and countershading in caterpillar-like prey subject to predation by wild avian predators.""",,"
The paper does not mention any conflicts of interest. There are no quotes that indicate the authors disclosed any conflicts of interest. The paper focuses on reporting the results of their field experiment on the protective value of eyespots and countershading in caterpillar-like prey.

""The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.""

Since the paper does not contain any statements about conflicts of interest, it appears that the authors did not declare any conflicts specifically.

Significance of butterfly eyespots as an anti-predator device in ground-based and aerial attacks,"Anne Lyytinen, Paul M Brakefield, Johanna Mappes",-,-,,91,2003,Lyytinen_2003.pdf,not declared specifically,"  - ""We did not find eyespots to be advantageous to butterflies when the attack came from the ground level or from above. In neither experiment did eyespot patterns increase the escape probability of butterflies once captured.""
  - ""We suggest two possible alternative hypotheses to account for the occurrence of spotted and spotless butterfly forms.""
  - ""To test the deflection hypothesis, we compared the survival of the spotless dry season form and spotted wet season form of Bicyclus anynana and examined the target of initial strike. We used two model predators: lizards (Anolis carolinensis) and pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) that are visually hunting insectivorous predators.""",,"
The paper does not mention any conflict of interests. There are no quotes that indicate the authors disclosed any potential conflicts of interest. The paper focuses on reporting the results of their experiments on the function of eyespots in butterflies as an anti-predator mechanism, without any mention of potential conflicts of interest.

The Feeding Behaviour of Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) in the Presence of 'Eyes',"I R Inglis, L W Huson, M B Marshall, P A Arid,  Neville",-,-,-,-,-,Inglis_1983.pdf,not declared specifically,"  - ""The subjects were eight adult starlings randomly selected from the central pool of wild caught birds.""
  - ""The entire apparatus was housed in a small room which was maintained at 15'C and h.td a 12 h on-12 h off light regime.""
