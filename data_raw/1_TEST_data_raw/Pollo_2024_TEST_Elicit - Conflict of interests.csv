,"Luis M Torres-Vila, Michael D Jennions, A Cockburn",-,-,-,-,-,Torres-Vila_2005.pdf,not declared specifically,"  - ""Our results support the claim that male mating history strongly affects female reproductive output in Lepidoptera.""
  - ""We then discuss our results in the light of the generally accepted statement that spermatophore size is primarily driven by sexual selection on males to reduce female remating rather than selection on males to provide paternal investment.""",,"
The paper does not mention any conflicts of interest. There are no statements from the authors regarding any potential conflicts of interest. The paper focuses on presenting the results of a meta-analysis on the effect of male mating history on female reproductive output in Lepidoptera species.

""We therefore performed a metaanalysis to explore the effect of male mating history on female reproductive output to ascertain whether a general trend across Lepidoptera species can be detected.""
""We then discuss our results in the light of the generally accepted statement that spermatophore size is primarily driven by sexual selection on males to reduce female remating rather than selection on males to provide paternal investment.""

Assortative Mating in Animals,"Yuexin Jiang, Daniel I Bolnick, Mark Kirkpatrick",-,-,American Naturalist,361,2013,Jiang_2013.pdf,not declared specifically,"  - ""We reviewed more than 13,000 publications. While the search was thorough, it is certain that there are publications that our search did not find.""
  - ""All analyses were performed in R (R Development Core Team 2009) using the package metafor (Viechtbauer 2010).""
  - ""We conducted a mixed-model meta-analysis of assortative mating based on phenotypic traits within natural animal populations.""",,"
The paper does not mention any conflicts of interest. There are no statements from the authors regarding any potential conflicts of interest. The paper focuses on presenting the results of a meta-analysis on assortative mating in animals, and does not discuss any potential conflicts that the authors may have.

Darwinian sex roles confirmed across the animal kingdom,"Tim Janicke, Ines K Häderer, Marc J Lajeunesse, Nils Anthes",-,-,Science Advances,323,2016,Janicke_2016.pdf,not declared specifically,,,"
The paper does not mention any conflicts of interest. There are no statements from the authors regarding any potential conflicts of interest. The paper does not contain a ""Conflicts of interest"" section or any other indication that the authors disclosed any conflicts of interest.

The paper does not contain any information about conflicts of interest.

Measuring and interpreting sexual selection metrics: evaluation and guidelines,"Nils Anthes, Ines K H € Aderer, Nico K Michiels, Tim Janicke",-,-,,41,2017,Anthes_2017.pdf,not declared specifically,"  - ""Data underlying the analyses in this manuscript are deposited in the Dryad repository for Figures 2 and 4 (http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad. rs69k) (Anthes et al. 2016) and all other Figures (http://datadryad.org/resource/ doi:10.5061/dryad.780d6) (Janicke et al. 2016).""",,"
The paper does not explicitly declare any conflicts of interest. There is no section or statement in the paper that discusses potential conflicts of interest. The closest relevant quote is:
""Data underlying the analyses in this manuscript are deposited in the Dryad repository for Figures 2 and 4 (http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad. rs69k) (Anthes et al. 2016) and all other Figures (http://datadryad.org/resource/ doi:10.5061/dryad.780d6) (Janicke et al. 2016).""
This indicates that the data used in the analysis is publicly available, but does not mention any potential conflicts of interest.

Mechanisms of Social Influence: A Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Social Information on Female Mate Choice Decisions,"Blake Carlton Jones, Emily H Duval",-,-,Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution,33,2019,Jones_2019.pdf,yes,"  - ""The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.""",,"
The paper states that the authors declare ""The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."" This indicates that the authors explicitly declared that there were no conflicts of interest.

""The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.""

No evidence of immediate fitness benefits of within-season divorce in monogamous birds,"Antica Culina, Lyanne Brouwer",-,-,Biology Letters,5,2022,Culina_2022.pdf,yes,"  - ""We declare we have no competing interests.""",,"
To determine if the conflict of interests was disclosed, I will look for any statements from the authors regarding potential conflicts of interest.
""We declare we have no competing interests.""
This quote directly states that the authors declare they have no conflicts of interest.

The relative importance of size and asymmetry in sexual selection,"R Thornhid', A P M0ller, A P Moller",-,-,,87,1998,Thornhill_1998.pdf,not declared specifically,"  - ""The aim of the present study was to test whether the magnitude of the effect of asymmetry on sexual selection was similar to that of character size per se, which is known from numerous studies to be related to sexual selection (see review in Andersson, 1994).""
  - ""The data set used for the present study is from Mailer and Thornhill (1998), which was based on (1) a comprehensive search of the literature and of the Internet for information on the relationship between asymmetry and sexual selection, and (2) correspondence between the authors and behavioral ecologists conducting research on this relationship.""
  - ""We are unaware of ways of performing meta-analyses in a phylogenetic framework, although such a solution eventually may become possible.""",,"
The paper does not mention any conflicts of interest. There are no statements from the authors regarding any potential conflicts of interest. The paper focuses entirely on the meta-analysis of the relationship between character size, symmetry, and sexual selection, without any discussion of the authors' own research or potential conflicts.
