Body size affects the evolution of eyespots in caterpillars,"Thomas John Hossie, John Skelhorn, Jesse W Breinholt, Akito Y Kawahara, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,49,2015,Hossie_2015.pdf,artificial,"  - ""Artificial caterpillars were designed to quantify the selective advantage of eyespots on large and small prey. Construction of artificial caterpillars followed a methodology similar to that used in previous studies (11,12).""
  - ""The design of artificial prey for the laboratory presentations to domestic chicks was slightly modified to allow the inclusion of two additional treatments to account for a possible confounding effect of eyespot size.""

The paper clearly states that the authors used artificial caterpillar models in both their field and laboratory experiments:

""Pastry caterpillars were manufactured with a 3:1 mixture of white flour and lard.""
""The design of artificial prey for the laboratory presentations to domestic chicks was slightly modified to allow the inclusion of two additional treatments to account for a possible confounding effect of eyespot size.""
The paper clearly states that the authors used artificial, not real, caterpillar models in their experiments.

Deflective effect and the effect of prey detectability on anti-predator function of eyespots,"Adrian Vallin, Marina Dimitrova, Ullasa Kodandaramaiah, Sami Merilaita, D Kemp",-,-,Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology,36,2011,Vallin_2011.pdf,artificial,"  - ""artificial, triangular prey items""
  - ""we used artificial, triangular prey items and blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) as predators.""
  - ""Prey types differed both within and between the experiments with respect to number, placement, and size of artificial eyespots.""
  - ""The prey items were isosceles triangular (b × h: 30×15 mm 2 ), and their grey ground color was identical to the grey of the concealing background (Fig. 1b, c ). In addition, there were three lines and nine dots, identical to the lines and dots of the concealing background, randomly distributed on each prey item.""",,"
The paper states that the authors used ""artificial, triangular prey items"" for their experiments:
""We used artificial, triangular prey items and blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) as predators.""
The paper also provides details on how the prey items were made:
""The prey items were isosceles triangular (b × h: 30×15 mm 2 ), and their grey ground color was identical to the grey of the concealing background (Fig. 1b, c ). In addition, there were three lines and nine dots, identical to the lines and dots of the concealing background, randomly distributed on each prey item.""
""Prey types differed both within and between the experiments with respect to number, placement, and size of artificial eyespots.""
Based on these quotes, it is clear that the authors used artificial, geometrical prey items rather than real butterflies or moths. The prey items were triangular in shape and had artificial eyespots and patterning added to them.

Eyespots interact with body colour to protect caterpillar-like prey from avian predators,"Thomas John Hossie, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,Animal Behaviour,36,2012,Hossie_2012.pdf,artificial,"  - ""Artificial caterpillars were designed to assess the protective value of eyespots and countershading on caterpillar prey in general; however, for ecological relevance, our prey were modelled loosely on Papilio canadensis.""
  - ""Tempera paint is an appropriate medium for eyespots as it dries in a smooth matte finish and the colours do not change over time (Mayer 1985).""
  - ""Specifically, pastry caterpillars were manufactured with a 3:1 mixture of white flour (White RoseÔ, White Rose Flour Mills, Byford, WA, U.S.A.) and lard (TenderflakeÔ, Maple Leaf Foods, Toronto, ON, Canada).""",,"

Field experiments on the effectiveness of 'eyespots' as predator deterrents,"Martin Stevens, Elinor Hopkins, William Hinde, Amabel Adcock, Yvonne Connolly, Tom Troscianko, Innes C Cuthill, K T Troscianko",-,-,-,-,-,Stevens_2007.pdf,artificial,"  - ""For all experiments, artificial moth-like stimuli (not designed to mimic any real species) were made from triangular pieces of waterproof card (HP LaserJet Tough Paper; Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA, U.S.A.), 50 mm wide at the base and 25 mm high, printed with specific patterns on a Hewlett Packard LaserJet 4050N printer.""

The paper indicates that the authors used artificial ""moth-like stimuli"" rather than real butterflies or moths. This is evident from the following quotes:

""For all experiments, artificial moth-like stimuli (not designed to mimic any real species) were made from triangular pieces of waterproof card (HP LaserJet Tough Paper; Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA, U.S.A.), 50 mm wide at the base and 25 mm high, printed with specific patterns on a Hewlett Packard LaserJet 4050N printer.""

Significance of butterfly eyespots as an anti-predator device in ground-based and aerial attacks,"Anne Lyytinen, Paul M Brakefield, Johanna Mappes",-,-,,91,2003,Lyytinen_2003.pdf,real,"  - ""To test whether eyespots affect the escape probability of butterflies after the attack, three forms (spotless, spotted, Bigeye-comet) of B. anynana differing in eyespot pattern, were placed one at a time on the slice of banana into the cages in the presence of a lizard.""
  - ""Bicyclus anynana (Satyrinae) shows variation in number, size, shape, colour composition, and position of eyespots (Brakefield and French 1999). For its natural range, in central Africa, an alternation of warm, wet and cool, dry seasons is characteristic. The larvae respond to high or low rearing temperatures by developing the spotted or spotless wings of the adult, respectively (Brakefield andLarsen 1984, Brakefield andReitsma 1991). The wet season form has seven eyespots on its hindwings and two on its forewings (Fig. 1 ). In the dry season form these eyespots are reduced in size or totally absent, the wings being uniformly brown. Furthermore, the resting butterfly covers the posterior forewing spot with its hindwings. In addition, we used a double mutant line, Bigeye-comet, in which all the eyespots are larger in size than in the wet season form.""",,"
The paper indicates that the authors used live specimens of the butterfly species Bicyclus anynana, as well as a mutant line of the same species called ""Bigeye-comet"" which had larger eyespots. This is evident from the following quotes:

The paper clearly states that the authors used live specimens of the butterfly species Bicyclus anynana, as well as a mutant line of the same species, rather than artificial patterns. Therefore, the ""Type prey"" is real.

The Feeding Behaviour of Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) in the Presence of 'Eyes',"I R Inglis, L W Huson, M B Marshall, P A Arid,  Neville",-,-,-,-,-,Inglis_1983.pdf,artificial,"  - ""realistic model of the head of an owl.""
  - ""The four stimuli were a) a blank card; b) two crosses arranged horizontally 6 cm apart, each measuring 2 x~ 2 cm; c) two triangular eyes arranged 6 cm apart, each consisting of an equilateral trianslc having sides 2 c m long and containing a black triangular 'pupil'; d) two circular eyes arranged 6 cm apart, each consisting of a circle of 2 cm diameter containing 1 cm diameter black 'pupil'.""",,"
The paper does not mention using any real butterfly, moth, or caterpillar species or their patterning. Instead, the authors used various artificial eye-like patterns drawn on white boards, such as:
""The four stimuli were a) a blank card; b) two crosses arranged horizontally 6 cm apart, each measuring 2 x~ 2 cm; c) two triangular eyes arranged 6 cm apart, each consisting of an equilateral trianslc having sides 2 c m long and containing a black triangular 'pupil'; d) two circular eyes arranged 6 cm apart, each consisting of a circle of 2 cm diameter containing 1 cm diameter black 'pupil'.""
The paper also mentions that the authors compared these artificial eye patterns to a ""realistic model of the head of an owl"":
""Finally, the effectiveness of a stimulus combining all the important features mentioned is as aversive as is a realistic model of the head of an owl.""
Therefore, the ""Type prey"" used in this study was artificial, not real butterfly, moth, or caterpillar species or their patterning.

  - ""We followed Hossie and Sherratt's (2013) method of producing countershaded pastry caterpillars based loosely on the appearance of the late instars of Papilio canadensis and Papilio glaucus caterpillars.""",,"
The paper states that the authors used artificial caterpillar models to conduct their experiments, rather than real caterpillars. This is evident from the following quotes:

The paper clearly states that the authors used artificial, pastry-based caterpillar models rather than real caterpillars.
