  - ""At 9 weeks of age, pigs were transported from a commercial farm to the experimental facilities of IRTA (Monells, Spain) and housed in two rooms of four pens with seven pigs each.""",,"
The paper states that the pigs used in the study were 9 weeks old when they were transported to the experimental facilities, and the treatments started when the pigs were 19 weeks old and lasted until 27 weeks of age (slaughter age). This indicates that the pigs were juvenile animals, as they were not sexually mature or close to sexual maturity during the experiment.

"Does stocking density modify affective state in pigs as assessed by cognitive bias, behavioural and physiological parameters?","Annalisa Scollo, Flaviana Gottardo, Barbara Contiero, Sandra A Edwards",-,-,,61,2014,Scollo2014.pdf,juvenile,"  - ""All experimental procedures and animal care were carried out in accordance with the minimum standards for the protection of pigs laid down by law (Council of The European Union, 2008), and were approved by the Ethical Review Committee of Newcastle University.""
  - ""A total of 40 entire male and female crossbred pigs (Large White × Landrace), which had previously experienced the same housing and management conditions, were selected at approximately 14 weeks of age and 45 kg live weight.""",,"
The paper does not explicitly state the age of the pigs used in the experiment. However, it provides some details that suggest the pigs were juvenile:
""A total of 40 entire male and female crossbred pigs (Large White × Landrace), which had previously experienced the same housing and management conditions, were selected at approximately 14 weeks of age and 45 kg live weight.""
The paper states that the pigs were selected at approximately 14 weeks of age, which indicates they were not sexually mature or close to sexual maturity. Additionally, the paper mentions the pigs had a live weight of 45 kg, which is typical for juvenile pigs.
""All experimental procedures and animal care were carried out in accordance with the minimum standards for the protection of pigs laid down by law (Council of The European Union, 2008), and were approved by the Ethical Review Committee of Newcastle University.""
The fact that the experiment was approved by an ethical review committee also suggests the pigs were juvenile, as experiments on adult pigs may have additional ethical considerations.

Effect of gender and halothane genotype on cognitive bias and its relationship with fear in pigs,"Ricard Carreras, Laura Arroyo, Eva Mainau, Raquel Pe Ña, Anna Bassols, Antoni Dalmau, Luigi Faucitano, Xavier Manteca, Antonio Velarde",-,-,,17,2016,Carreras2016.pdf,juvenile,"  - ""At 19 weeks of age, pigs were trained and tested individually for the CB according to the methodology described by Carreras et al. (2015).""
  - ""At 9 weeks of age, pigs were transported from a commercial farm to the experimental facilities of IRTA (Monells, Spain) and housed separately by gender and genotype in 8 pens (6 pigs per pen).""",,"
The paper states that the pigs were transported to the experimental facilities at 9 weeks of age and were tested at 19 weeks of age:
""At 9 weeks of age, pigs were transported from a commercial farm to the experimental facilities of IRTA (Monells, Spain) and housed separately by gender and genotype in 8 pens (6 pigs per pen).""
""At 19 weeks of age, pigs were trained and tested individually for the CB according to the methodology described by Carreras et al. (2015).""
Since the pigs were tested at 19 weeks of age, which is before they would have reached sexual maturity, the age of the animals used in this experiment can be classified as juvenile.

  - ""newly weaned non-sibling mice (21-25 days old at delivery)""",,"
The paper states that the mice used in the experiment were ""newly weaned non-sibling mice (21-25 days old at delivery)"". This indicates that the mice were juvenile, as they were not sexually mature at the start of the experiment.

""Subjects were 192 female mice, 96 each of the inbred strain C57BL/6JRj (C57) and the outbred strain RjOrl:SWISS (SWISS) from Janvier Labs, France. Each batch was comprised of 48 newly weaned non-sibling mice (21-25 days old at delivery) per strain.""

The paper does not mention any adult mice being used in the experiment.

Frontal brain deactivation during a non-verbal cognitive judgement bias test in sheep,"Kathrin Guldimann, Sabine Vögeli, Martin Wolf, Beat Wechsler, Lorenz Gygax",-,-,Brain and Cognition,20,2015,Guldimann2015.pdf,adult,"  - ""To induce a relatively more negative or more positive mood, the sheep had been subjected to either unpredictable, stimulus-poor or predictable, stimulus-rich housing conditions, respectively, since July 2011 (Vögeli et al., 2014).""
  - ""Twenty-nine female non-lactating and non-gestating Lacaune sheep about 2.5 years of age made up the two groups used in this experiment (Vögeli et al., 2014).""",,"
The paper does not explicitly state the age of the sheep used in the experiment. However, it does provide some information about the age of the sheep:
""Twenty-nine female non-lactating and non-gestating Lacaune sheep about 2.5 years of age made up the two groups used in this experiment (Vögeli et al., 2014).""
This quote indicates that the sheep were approximately 2.5 years old, which would classify them as adult animals.
""To induce a relatively more negative or more positive mood, the sheep had been subjected to either unpredictable, stimulus-poor or predictable, stimulus-rich housing conditions, respectively, since July 2011 (Vögeli et al., 2014).""
This quote suggests that the sheep had been in the housing conditions for over 2 years, further supporting that they were adult animals.

  - ""Female Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) were hatched and reared at the Institute of Animal Biochemistry and Genetics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Ivanka pri Dunaji, Slovak Republic.""",,"
The paper does not explicitly state the age of the Japanese quail used in the experiments. However, it does provide some relevant information:
""Female Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) were hatched and reared at the Institute of Animal Biochemistry and Genetics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Ivanka pri Dunaji, Slovak Republic.""
This suggests that the quail were likely juveniles, as they were hatched and reared for the experiments.
""The quails were group housed in wire cages with floor space 5620 cm 2 (maximum 12 birds per cage). During the housing manipulation part of birds was housed in deep litter pens. The deep litter pen had floor space 7870 cm 2 . Its floor was covered with wood shavings, and the birds were provided with nipple drinkers and feeders. The birds were group housed in groups of 3 to 10.""
The fact that the quail were group housed in cages and pens, and that the paper refers to them as ""birds"", further suggests that they were likely juvenile or young adult quail, rather than fully mature adults.
