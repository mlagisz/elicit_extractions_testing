The study type appears to be experimental based on the following evidence from the paper:
""Carbofuran (CAS NO: 1563-66-2, purity !98.8%) was purchased from the Shanghai Pesticide Research Institute (Shanghai, China). Carbofuran was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to obtain a 10 mg/mL stock solution, which was further used to prepare the fresh diluted solution (500 mg/mL) during the exposure experiment. The exposure experiments were conducted in 5-L glass tanks filled with 4 L of carbofuran exposure or solvent control medium, each tank contained 6 female zebrafish.""
This quote indicates that the researchers conducted a controlled exposure experiment where they exposed zebrafish to different concentrations of carbofuran.

"Tributyltin enhanced anxiety of adult male zebrafish through elevating cortisol level and disruption in serotonin, dopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid neurotransmitter pathways","Xin Tu, Ying-Wen Li, Qi-Liang Chen, Yan-Jun Shen, Zhi-Hao Liu",-,-,Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,36,2020,tu_2020.pdf,experimental,,,"
The study type is experimental. This is evident from several quotes in the paper:
After domestication, 54 uniform-sized (0.32 ± 0.06 g) male fish were randomly selected. The fish were then separated into 3 groups (Control, 0.05% DMSO; TBT-low, 100 ng/L and TBT-high, 500 ng/L) with triplicate tanks (50 cm × 25 cm × 30 cm, containing 6 individuals in 20 L exposure water per tank) per group. The fish were then exposed to corresponding concentrations of TBT for 28 days with a 14 h/10 h light/ darkness photoperiod and fed with Artemia nauplii (Artemia International LCC, USA) and flake food daily (1.5% body weight per day) during exposure.
This quote describes how the researchers randomly assigned the fish to different treatment groups and exposed them to varying concentrations of TBT, which is a clear experimental design.
After exposure, the novel tank dive test was conducted following the method provided by Egan et al. (2009). Briefly, the test tank (15 cm × 20 cm × 25 cm) with 10 cm water was divided equally into two parts (lower and upper) by drawing a horizontal line (5 cm from the bottom) through the center of the water column prior to the test. Three fish from each tank (9 fish for each group; N = 9) was then placed into the test tank individually.
This quote further describes the experimental procedure of the novel tank dive test, which was used to assess the anxiety-like behavior of the fish.
