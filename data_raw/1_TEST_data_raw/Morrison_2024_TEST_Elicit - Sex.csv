The paper does not explicitly state the sex of the zebrafish used in the pesticide exposure experiments. However, it does provide some relevant information:
""Experimentally naïve zebrafish of both sexes (50% each) and similar size were used. Since gender could affect the behavioral outcome, we previously analyzed our data observing no statistical differences between males and females (data not shown).""
This quote indicates that the researchers used both male and female zebrafish, in equal proportions, for the adult zebrafish behavioral experiments.
""All animals belonged to the same strain (TAB5) and were raised and manipulated equally.""
This quote suggests that the researchers used a consistent population of zebrafish, without distinguishing between males and females, for the larval zebrafish experiments.
""To record and analyze the behavior of adult zebrafish treated with TDF 5 mg/L and 20 mg/L we followed the methods described in Cachat et al. (2011).""
This quote indicates that the adult zebrafish experiments used both male and female zebrafish, as that is the standard practice described in the referenced paper.

Carbofuran induces increased anxiety-like behaviors in female zebrafish (Danio rerio) through disturbing dopaminergic/ norepinephrinergic system,"Shuang Liu, Miao Yu, Xincen Xie, Yiran Ru, Shaoguo Ru, David Volz",-,-,-,-,-,liu_2020.pdf,female,"  - ""In this study, female zebrafish were used as test organisms to evaluate the effects of carbofuran exposure for 48 h on anxiety-like behaviors using a novel tank diving test.""

The paper explicitly states that female zebrafish were used as the test organisms in this study:
""Wild-type sexually mature (5-month-old) female zebrafish (length, 2.92 ± 0.24 cm; wet weight, 0.43 ± 0.09 g) were obtained from a local supplier (Nanshan Aquaria, Qingdao, China) and then acclimated in 50-L glass tanks containing 40 L of culture water for approximately 40 days prior to the experiments.""

The paper clearly states that only female zebrafish were used in the pesticide exposure experiments to measure effects on behavior.

The paper explicitly states that the study focused on male zebrafish:

Neurobehavioral Impairments Caused by Developmental Imidacloprid Exposure in Zebrafish,"Emily B Crosby, Jordan M Bailey, Anthony N Oliveri, Edward D Levin",-,-,Neurotoxicology and Teratology,145,2015,crosby_2015.pdf,"both/mixed, not reported","  - ""All subjects used in the larval activity analyses and adolescent/adult tests were without overt physical malformation at the beginning of exposures.""
  - ""Several adolescent or adult zebrafish across all exposure groups exhibited a mild mini-fin mutant phenotype (Connors et al., 1999), which was only apparent as the fish increased in size).

  - ""All zebrafish, in each testing age group (i.e. larval, adolescent and adult), were treated with imidacloprid, nicotine or vehicle control for 0-5 dpf (with daily renewal of solutions).""",,"
The paper does not explicitly state the sex of the zebrafish used in the pesticide exposure experiment. However, it provides some relevant information that can be used to infer the sex of the zebrafish:

""All zebrafish, in each testing age group (i.e. larval, adolescent and adult), were treated with imidacloprid, nicotine or vehicle control for 0-5 dpf (with daily renewal of solutions).""
This quote indicates that the zebrafish were not differentiated by sex for the exposure experiment, as the same treatments were applied to all zebrafish regardless of age group.

""Several adolescent or adult zebrafish across all exposure groups exhibited a mild mini-fin mutant phenotype (Connors et al., 1999), which was only apparent as the fish increased in size). This is a genetic malformation of the tail that can alter swimming; consequently, all mini-fin subjects were excluded from behavioral testing.""
This quote suggests that the zebrafish used were a mix of males and females, as the mini-fin mutation can occur in both sexes.

""All subjects used in the larval activity analyses and adolescent/adult tests were without overt physical malformation at the beginning of exposures.""
This quote indicates that the zebrafish used were selected to be physically normal at the start of the experiment, without specifying sex.

The paper does not explicitly state the sex of the zebrafish used in the experiment. However, it does mention that ""Adult zebrafish (Danio rerio as GloFish™) of mixed gender were purchased from a local commercial supplier and maintained in the Open-RAC recirculating zebrafish maintenance system.""

The paper mentions that the zebrafish used in the experiments were a mix of males and females. This is evident from the following quotes:
""Cohorts of tested fish contained equal numbers of male and female zebrafish, as available within offspring bred for this study.""
""Sample sizes of analyzed data were between 21 and 30 for each group for any given test, based on survival to late adulthood and adequate motion tracking of collected videos (subject identified in >96% of images within video).""

The paper explicitly states that the cohorts contained equal numbers of male and female zebrafish, and also discusses sex differences in the results, indicating that both male and female zebrafish were used in the experiments.

The paper explicitly states that the zebrafish used in the experiment were adult male zebrafish:

""The fish were then separated into 3 groups (Control, 0.05% DMSO; TBT-low, 100 ng/L and TBT-high, 500 ng/L) with triplicate tanks (50 cm × 25 cm × 30 cm, containing 6 individuals in 20 L exposure water per tank) per group.""
""After exposure, the novel tank dive test was conducted following the method provided by Egan et al. (2009). Briefly, the test tank (15 cm × 20 cm × 25 cm) with 10 cm water was divided equally into two parts (lower and upper) by drawing a horizontal line (5 cm from the bottom) through the center of the water column prior to the test. Three fish from each tank (9 fish for each group; N = 9) was then placed into the test tank individually.""
The paper clearly states that the zebrafish used in the experiment were adult male zebrafish.

Zebrafish provide a sensitive model of persisting neurobehavioral effects of developmental chlorpyrifos exposure: Comparison with nicotine and pilocarpine effects and relationship to dopamine deficits,"Donnie Eddins, Daniel Cerutti, Paul Williams, Elwood Linney, Edward D Levin",-,-,Neurotoxicology and Teratology,232,2010,eddins_2010.pdf,not reported,"  - ""Adult zebrafish (D. rerio) were kept at approximately 28.5 °C on a 12:12-hour light\dark cycle.""

The paper does not explicitly state the sex of the zebrafish used in the pesticide exposure experiment. However, it does provide some relevant information that can be used to infer the sex:
""Adult zebrafish (D. rerio) were kept at approximately 28.5 °C on a 12:12-hour light\dark cycle.""
This suggests that the zebrafish were adults, but does not specify whether they were male, female, or a mix of both sexes.
""Subjects were brought from the colony room to the test room in their home tanks. In the test room they were netted and placed in test arenas where they were left for a ten-minute acclimatization before testing (introduction to the test arena produced 1 or 2 min of rapid swimming, followed by a stable pattern of swim bouts).""
This indicates that the zebrafish were tested in groups, but does not provide any information about the sex composition of those groups.
""For immediate effects of CPF exposure on, 0-5 days post-fertilization, neurochemical levels (six days post-fertilization), larvae were grouped approximately 50/group.""
This quote refers to the zebrafish larvae used for neurochemical analysis, but again does not specify the sex of these individuals.
