Body size affects the evolution of eyespots in caterpillars,"Thomas John Hossie, John Skelhorn, Jesse W Breinholt, Akito Y Kawahara, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,49,2015,Hossie_2015.pdf,NA,,,"
The paper does not mention the sex of the birds used in the field experiments. There are no quotes that specify the sex of the birds. The paper only refers to ""avian predators"" and ""wild birds"" without any indication of the sex of the birds.

Deflective effect and the effect of prey detectability on anti-predator function of eyespots,"Adrian Vallin, Marina Dimitrova, Ullasa Kodandaramaiah, Sami Merilaita, D Kemp",-,-,Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology,36,2011,Vallin_2011.pdf,NA,"  - ""blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus)""

  - ""The experimental protocol and housing of birds was reviewed and approved by the regional ethical committee in Linköping (Dnr: 62-08). We caught blue tits at the research station using mist nets and housed them indoors in individual cages (80×60×40 cm).""",,"
The paper does not explicitly state the sex of the birds used in the experiments. However, it does mention that the birds used were ""blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus)"". Blue tits are a species of small passerine bird, and both males and females have similar plumage coloration. The paper does not provide any information that would indicate the sex of the individual birds used.
""We used wild caught blue tits, C. caeruleus, as predators, because they are insectivorous passerines and have been successfully used in previous predation experiments on butterflies and eyespots (e.g., Vallin et al. 2006, 2007).""

Eyespots interact with body colour to protect caterpillar-like prey from avian predators,"Thomas John Hossie, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,Animal Behaviour,36,2012,Hossie_2012.pdf,NA,,,"
The paper does not specify the sex of the birds that were observed preying on the artificial caterpillars. There are no quotes that indicate the sex of the birds involved in the study. The paper only mentions ""insectivorous birds"" and lists the bird species observed at the study sites, but does not provide any information about the sex of these birds.

Field experiments on the effectiveness of 'eyespots' as predator deterrents,"Martin Stevens, Elinor Hopkins, William Hinde, Amabel Adcock, Yvonne Connolly, Tom Troscianko, Innes C Cuthill, K T Troscianko",-,-,-,-,-,Stevens_2007.pdf,both,"  - ""The main avian predators in the area were blue tits, great tits, Parus major, European robins, Erithacus rubecula, Chaffinches, Fringilla coelebs, and house sparrows, Passer domesticus.""",,"
The paper does not explicitly mention the sex of the birds used in the experiments. However, it does provide some relevant information about the avian predators in the study area:

""The main avian predators in the area were blue tits, great tits, Parus major, European robins, Erithacus rubecula, Chaffinches, Fringilla coelebs, and house sparrows, Passer domesticus.""

This list includes both male and female birds, as these species typically have both sexes present in the wild. The paper does not indicate whether the experiments specifically used male, female, or a mix of both sexes of these predator species.

Additionally, the paper states that the experiments were designed to reduce the chances that any one bird would encounter multiple targets:

""All experiments consisted of a randomized block design, with a sample of replicates of each treatment pinned out over a series of blocks. Each block consisted of one nonlinear transect, each in different region of the woods and on a different date. Treatments were randomly allocated to suitable trees, defined as having little or no lichen cover and a trunk circumference of greater than 0.9 m. The low density of targets within a block and the fact that replicate blocks took place in different parts of the wood, were features designed to reduce the chances that any one bird would encounter multiple targets.""

This suggests that the experiments likely involved a mix of male and female birds from the local predator population, rather than focusing on a single sex.

Significance of butterfly eyespots as an anti-predator device in ground-based and aerial attacks,"Anne Lyytinen, Paul M Brakefield, Johanna Mappes",-,-,,91,2003,Lyytinen_2003.pdf,NA,"  - ""We trapped the birds in Konnevesi, Central Finland and put them into illuminated cages (65 × 80× 65 cm) where they were maintained on the diet of mealworms and water ad libitum.

The paper does not explicitly mention the sex of the birds used in the experiments. The only information provided about the birds is that they were ""pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca)"", which is a species of small passerine bird. There is no indication that the sex of the individual birds was a factor in the study.

The Feeding Behaviour of Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) in the Presence of 'Eyes',"I R Inglis, L W Huson, M B Marshall, P A Arid,  Neville",-,-,-,-,-,Inglis_1983.pdf,both,"  - ""we compared the first principal component scores derived from the data of the initial control trials for males and females and found no significant differences.""
  - ""compared the first principal component scores derived from the data of the initial control trials for males and females and found no significant differences.""
  - ""only starlings in adult plumage were used in these experiments""",,"
The paper does not explicitly state the sex of the starling subjects used in the experiments. However, it does mention that ""only starlings in adult plumage were used in these experiments"" and that the researchers ""compared the first principal component scores derived from the data of the initial control trials for males and females and found no significant differences."" This suggests that both male and female starlings were used in the experiments, but their sex was not a factor in the analysis.

The position of eyespots and thickened segments influence their protective value to caterpillars,"John Skelhorn, Giles Dorrington, Thomas J Hossie, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,,15,2014,Skelhorn_2014.pdf,NA,"  - ""All chicks were marked with nontoxic ""child-friendly"" colored marker pens to enable individual identification: this did not appear to have any adverse effect in chick behavior.""
  - ""Fifty-nine newly hatched domestic chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus) of the ""Ross"" strain were purchased from a commercial hatchery in Berwickshire, UK.""",,"
The paper does not explicitly state the sex of the birds used in the experiments. However, it does provide some relevant information:
""Fifty-nine newly hatched domestic chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus) of the ""Ross"" strain were purchased from a commercial hatchery in Berwickshire, UK.""
This indicates that the birds used were chicks, which are young birds before they have developed secondary sexual characteristics. The paper does not mention separating the chicks by sex or using only males or females.
""All chicks were marked with nontoxic ""child-friendly"" colored marker pens to enable individual identification: this did not appear to have any adverse effect in chick behavior.""
This further suggests that the chicks were not differentiated by sex, as the authors do not mention any differences in behavior or response between male and female chicks.

"The protective value of conspicuous signals is not impaired by shape, size, or position asymmetry","Martin Stevens, Sarah A Castor-Perry, Jessica R F Price",-,-,,19,2009,Stevens&CastorPerry_2009.pdf,NA,,,"
The paper does not mention the sex of the birds that were the predators in the experiments. There are no quotes that specify the sex of the birds. The paper only refers to ""wild avian predators"" and ""small songbirds"" without any indication of the sex composition of the predator population.
