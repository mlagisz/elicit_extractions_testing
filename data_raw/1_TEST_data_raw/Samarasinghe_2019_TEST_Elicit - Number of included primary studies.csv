To determine the number of included primary studies in this systematic review, I will look for relevant quotes that explicitly state the total number of studies included.

""Seventy eligible papers were identified through systematic searches across six electronic databases.""
This quote directly states that 70 eligible papers were included in the systematic review.

""After excluding duplicates and making exclusions based on title and abstract, 73 papers remained. Twenty of these studies were excluded based on full text. Backward screening of the remaining 53 papers' reference lists and forward screening of citations yielded 17 more papers, resulting in a total amount of 70 eligible papers for this review.""
