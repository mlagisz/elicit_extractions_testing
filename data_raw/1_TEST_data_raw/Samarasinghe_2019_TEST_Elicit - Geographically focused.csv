Built environmental correlates of older adults' total physical activity and walking: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"David W Barnett, Anthony Barnett, Andrea Nathan, Jelle Van Cauwenberg, Ester Cerin",-,-,-,-,-,Barnett_2017.pdf,no,"  - ""One postulated reason for the lack of consistent significant associations between environmental correlates and PA was the relative 'western' bias of the reviewed research -68% of the 31 articles reviewed by Van Cauwenberg and colleagues were from North America alone [15]. This is an important limitation since homogenously low-density western cities lack environmental variability potentially resulting in the underestimation of the strength of associations between the built environment and PA. Also, western cities differ from the built environments of Africa, Asia, and South America, limiting the generalizability of findings [16][17][18].

The paper states that the review aimed to provide a ""timely, robust overview of studies that investigated associations of built environmental attributes and estimates of total PA, including total walking."" It does not specify that the review was geographically focused on any particular region or country. In fact, the paper notes that the previous review by Van Cauwenberg et al. in 2011 had a ""western bias"" with 68% of the studies coming from North America, and that this review aimed to include more evidence from non-Western countries to address this limitation:

""One postulated reason for the lack of consistent significant associations between environmental correlates and PA was the relative 'western' bias of the reviewed research -68% of the 31 articles reviewed by Van Cauwenberg and colleagues were from North America alone [15]. This is an important limitation since homogenously low-density western cities lack environmental variability potentially resulting in the underestimation of the strength of associations between the built environment and PA. Also, western cities differ from the built environments of Africa, Asia, and South America, limiting the generalizability of findings [16][17][18]. In consideration of the recent growing evidence from nonwestern countries (e.g., [19][20][21][22][23][24][25]), an update of the literature was necessary.""

Furthermore, the inclusion criteria for the review did not specify that only studies from particular geographic regions were eligible. The paper states:

""Article eligibility for inclusion was based on the following criteria: (1) published in English between 1st January 2000 and 3rd September 2016; (2) quantitative study; (3) study with a cross-sectional, longitudinal or quasi-experimental design; (4) a sample with a mean age ≥ 65 years; (5) investigated the association between any objective or perceived attribute of the built environment and objectively measured or self-reported PA and/or walking that was not specific to a single PA domain only; (6) did not exclusively focus on clinical populations (e.g., overweight, disabled or institutionalised participants); and (7) did not investigate associations between PA and the built environment with an ill-defined aggregated environmental measure that, for example, combined two weakly correlated attributes such as access to/availability of recreational facilities and traffic/ pedestrian safety.""

Economic analysis of the health impacts of housing improvement studies: a systematic review,"Elisabeth Fenwick, Catriona Macdonald, Hilary Thomson",-,-,Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health,35,2013,Fenwick_2013.pdf,no,"  - ""All housing intervention studies and their associated papers included in the 2009 systematic review of the health impacts of housing improvement 14 were examined for reports of costs and economic analyses.""
  - ""This was especially the case for warmth improvements targeted at those with poor health, living in poor housing.

  - ""Over 75% of the studies (n=19) were from the UK, 17-35 41 with one study each from New Zealand, 16 the USA, 40 Mexico, 36 Philippines, 37 Pakistan 38 and Malawi. 39""",,"
The paper does not explicitly state that the review is geographically focused. The abstract mentions that the review included ""studies from around the world"", and the introduction states that the review ""included studies from around the world, concluded that housing improvements can lead to health improvements."" This suggests the review aimed to collect evidence globally, without restricting to a particular geographic region.

Impacts of heat waves and corresponding measures: a review,"Jian Zuo, Stephen Pullen, Jasmine Palmer, Helen Bennetts, Nicholas Chileshe, Tony Ma",-,-,,228,2015,Zuo_2015.pdf,no,"  - ""The aim of this research is to present a critical review of impacts of heat waves and corresponding mechanisms.""
  - ""There have been a number of record-breaking heat waves in Australia in recent years.""",,"
The paper does not explicitly state that the review is geographically focused on a particular region. The abstract mentions that the review covers the effects of heat waves and mechanisms to mitigate their effects, without specifying any geographic limitations:
""This is compounded by future climate scenarios which indicate more frequent and severe heat waves in certain locations. Hence it is timely to undertake a critical and systematic review of the effects of heat waves and mechanisms to mitigate their effects.""
The introduction also discusses heat waves in Australia, but does not indicate that the review is limited to that region:
""There have been a number of record-breaking heat waves in Australia in recent years.""
""Similarly, heat waves in other states such as Western Australia and South Australia were also well documented in both academic studies and industry reports.""
The aim of the research is stated as:
""The aim of this research is to present a critical review of impacts of heat waves and corresponding mechanisms.""
There is no mention of the review being geographically focused on any particular region.

Latent heat storage in building elements: A systematic review on properties and contextual performance factors,"A Mavrigiannaki, E Ampatzi",-,-,,76,2016,Mavrigiannaki_2016.pdf,no,"  - ""all relevant publications indexed in the two databases""
  - ""encompasses and critically evaluates all relevant literature to date,""
  - ""The present review is concerned with LHS, having a focus on PCM integration in building elements.""
  - ""The search was deliberately broad, to allow all relevant publications indexed in the two databases to be identified.""
  - ""The systematic review presented here builds on a wellestablished methodology originating from the health and social sciences [21][22]. This methodology is applied here, not only to assure the comprehensiveness of the research, but also to guide the filtering of information identified.""",,"
The paper does not explicitly state that the review is geographically focused. The introduction mentions that the review ""encompasses and critically evaluates all relevant literature to date"", without specifying any geographic limitations. Additionally, the search strategy used ""broad"" keywords to identify ""all relevant publications indexed in the two databases"", again without any geographic restrictions.
""The systematic review presented here builds on a wellestablished methodology originating from the health and social sciences [21][22]. This methodology is applied here, not only to assure the comprehensiveness of the research, but also to guide the filtering of information identified.""
""The search was deliberately broad, to allow all relevant publications indexed in the two databases to be identified.""
""The present review is concerned with LHS, having a focus on PCM integration in building elements.""
Based on the lack of any explicit geographic focus in the aims or inclusion criteria of the review, the evidence suggests that the review was not geographically focused.

The paper does not indicate that the systematic review is geographically focused. The abstract and introduction state that the aim is to ""address the question, how can the energy sector increase engagement from consumers using online and interactive media communications?"" without specifying any geographic limitations. The inclusion criteria also do not mention any geographic restrictions, stating only that the objectives and outcomes must relate to the central research question.

Relationship between the physical environment and different domains of physical activity in European adults: a systematic review,"Veerle Van Holle, Benedicte Deforche, Jelle Van Cauwenberg, Liesbet Goubert, Lea Maes, Nico Van De Weghe, Ilse De Bourdeaudhuij",-,-,BMC Public Health,314,2012,VanHolle_2012.pdf,yes,"  - ""Eligible publications had to be cross-sectional or longitudinal studies, investigating the relationship between objective or subjective measures of PA and the physical environment. Exclusion criteria were set as follows: studies describing exclusively non-European samples and/or populations outside the specified age range were not eligible.""
  - ""This systematic review aimed at summarizing Europe-specific evidence on the relationship between the physical environment and different PA domains in adults.""",,"
The paper states that the aim of this systematic review was to summarize Europe-specific evidence on the relationship between the physical environment and different PA domains in adults:
""This systematic review aimed at summarizing Europe-specific evidence on the relationship between the physical environment and different PA domains in adults.""
The inclusion criteria also specify that the review was focused on European adult samples:
""Eligible publications had to be cross-sectional or longitudinal studies, investigating the relationship between objective or subjective measures of PA and the physical environment. Exclusion criteria were set as follows: studies describing exclusively non-European samples and/or populations outside the specified age range were not eligible.""
Therefore, based on the stated aims and inclusion criteria, this systematic review was geographically focused on Europe.

The use of climate information to estimate future mortality from high ambient temperature: A systematic literature review,"Michael Sanderson, Katherine Arbuthnott, Sari Kovats, Shakoor Hajat, Pete Falloon",-,-,PLoS ONE,78,2017,Sanderson_2017.pdf,no,"  - ""There are very few or no temperature was increased by a fixed amount; Rel-the mortality threshold was modified by applying the percentile of the threshold to future temperatures and then adjusting the threshold to be between these two limits; slope-the slope of the exposure-response function was reduced; analogue city-use of exposure-response functions for a city whose present-day temperatures are similar to those projected to occur at the location of interest in the future.""
  - ""The majority of the locations studied are cities in high income countries including Canada, USA, European countries, South Korea and Australia (Table 1 ). The locations and numbers of studies which estimated future mortality for each city are shown in S1 Fig.""
  - ""The locations studied, time periods, climate models, emissions scenarios and treatment of adaptation are summarised in Table 1 , together with the meteorological variables used in each study.""",,"
The paper does not explicitly state that the review is geographically focused. The abstract mentions that the review covers ""a wide range of locations studied"" and the introduction states that the locations studied are ""mainly cities in high income countries including Canada, USA, European countries, South Korea and Australia"". However, the paper does not specify that the review is limited to only these geographic regions.

The paper does not state that the review is limited to only certain geographic regions. While it notes that the majority of studies are from high-income countries, it does not explicitly exclude studies from other regions. The review appears to have a global scope, even if the actual studies included are geographically focused on high-income countries.

The paper does not explicitly state that the review is geographically focused. The aims of the review are to ""systematically evaluate whether there is conclusive scientific evidence for the effectiveness of urban green spaces as a psychological buffer for the negative impact of noise pollution on human health"" and to ""promote an evidence-based approach toward this still growing environmental hazard."" There is no mention of the review being limited to a particular geographic region or area.

""The aim of this review was to systematically evaluate whether there is conclusive scientific evidence for the effectiveness of urban green spaces as a psychological buffer for the negative impact of noise pollution on human health and to promote an evidence-based approach toward this still growing environmental hazard.""
""MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched for experimental and epidemiological studies published before June 04, 2013 in English and Spanish.""
""We also hand searched the reference lists of the publications selected for quality assessment but we were unable to retrieve the full texts because of the limited access the Library Center of Medical University Plovdiv provided at that moment.""

The paper does mention that the review was limited to studies published in English and Spanish due to lack of funding for external translation, but this does not necessarily mean the review was geographically focused. The authors state they were unable to retrieve some full-text articles due to limited access, but this was a limitation of the review process rather than a geographic focus.
