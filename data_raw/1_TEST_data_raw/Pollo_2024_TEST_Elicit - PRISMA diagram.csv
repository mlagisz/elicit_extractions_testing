The paper does not mention or provide a PRISMA diagram or any other flowchart describing the literature search and screening process used to identify the studies included in the meta-analysis. The paper states:

This indicates that the authors conducted a literature search to identify relevant studies, but they do not provide any details on the specific search strategy, inclusion/exclusion criteria, or the number of studies screened versus included. Without this information, it is not possible to assess the completeness and transparency of the literature search and screening process.

Assortative Mating in Animals,"Yuexin Jiang, Daniel I Bolnick, Mark Kirkpatrick",-,-,American Naturalist,361,2013,Jiang_2013.pdf,not applicable,"  - ""We reviewed more than 13,000 publications. While the search was thorough, it is certain that there are publications that our search did not find. However, an exhaustive search is not necessary for meta-analysis, which is fundamentally a sampling activity intended to retrieve studies that are representative of the question of interest.""
  - ""We searched for publications reporting suitable measures of assortative mating, using keywords searches in multiple databases, including Google Scholar, JSTOR, and Web of Science. We also examined the reference sections of relevant publications to find additional studies.""
  - ""We excluded studies of assortative mating between incipient species, populations undergoing secondary contact or other forms of hybridization, host races, as well as populations whose conspecific status is ambiguous. Our focus is on the strength of assortment within single populations rather than reproductive isolation between divergent populations or incipient species.""",,"
The paper does not mention a ""PRISMA diagram"" or any other flowchart depicting the literature search and screening process. Instead, the paper provides the following details about their search and screening methods:

The paper does not provide a flowchart or diagram depicting the literature search and screening process, as is typically seen in a PRISMA diagram. Instead, the authors describe their search and screening methods in the text. Based on this, the appropriate answer is that a PRISMA-like flowchart is not applicable for this paper.

Measuring and interpreting sexual selection metrics: evaluation and guidelines,"Nils Anthes, Ines K H € Aderer, Nico K Michiels, Tim Janicke",-,-,,41,2017,Anthes_2017.pdf,not applicable,"  - ""Throughout, we exemplify those issues with a focus on the Bateman gradient (b ss ), representing a widely used integrative proxy of sexual selection (Klug et al. 2010)""

The paper does not mention or provide a PRISMA diagram. There is no indication that the authors conducted a systematic literature search and screening process to identify the studies included in their analysis. The paper states that the data used in the analyses comes from a ""meta-analysis database"" (Janicke et al. 2016), but does not describe how that database was compiled.

The paper focuses on analyzing and critiquing the methods used in previous studies on sexual selection metrics, rather than describing a systematic review process itself.

Mechanisms of Social Influence: A Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Social Information on Female Mate Choice Decisions,"Blake Carlton Jones, Emily H Duval",-,-,Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution,33,2019,Jones_2019.pdf,adequate,"  - ""We further excluded 24 studies that assessed mate-choice copying but did not determine individual choices.

The paper states that the authors followed the steps of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines:
""Following the steps of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA, [24]) 33 eligible studies were detected (see data tables, also electronic supplementary material, Methods for PRISMA diagrams).""
This indicates that the authors provided a PRISMA diagram or flowchart to document their literature search and screening process. The paper also states that the details on the complete search syntaxes and PRISMA diagrams can be found in the electronic supplementary materials.

The relative importance of size and asymmetry in sexual selection,"R Thornhid', A P M0ller, A P Moller",-,-,,87,1998,Thornhill_1998.pdf,not applicable,"  - ""The data set used for the present study is from Mailer and Thornhill (1998), which was based on (1) a comprehensive search of the literature and of the Internet for information on the relationship between asymmetry and sexual selection, and (2) correspondence between the authors and behavioral ecologists conducting research on this relationship.""
  - ""Because we investigated the relative effect size for symmetry versus character size for the same trait, the only studies included from Mailer and Thornhill (1998) were those that had one or more estimates that allowed calculation of an effect size for the relationship between asymmetry and character size, and mating success or a mate preference, respectively.""",,"
The paper does not mention or provide a PRISMA diagram. There is no indication that the authors conducted a systematic literature search and screening process to identify the studies included in the meta-analysis. Instead, the paper states that the data set used was from a previous meta-analysis by the same authors:

""The data set used for the present study is from Mailer and Thornhill (1998), which was based on (1) a comprehensive search of the literature and of the Internet for information on the relationship between asymmetry and sexual selection, and (2) correspondence between the authors and behavioral ecologists conducting research on this relationship.""

The paper also mentions that they only included studies from the previous meta-analysis that had information on both size and asymmetry:

""Because we investigated the relative effect size for symmetry versus character size for the same trait, the only studies included from Mailer and Thornhill (1998) were those that had one or more estimates that allowed calculation of an effect size for the relationship between asymmetry and character size, and mating success or a mate preference, respectively.""

Since the current paper does not describe a systematic literature search and screening process, but rather uses a pre-existing data set, the PRISMA diagram is not applicable.

The paper does not mention or provide a PRISMA diagram. There is no indication that the authors conducted a systematic literature search and screening process to identify relevant studies for their meta-analysis.
