Built environmental correlates of older adults' total physical activity and walking: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"David W Barnett, Anthony Barnett, Andrea Nathan, Jelle Van Cauwenberg, Ester Cerin",-,-,-,-,-,Barnett_2017.pdf,"Cinahl, PubMed, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, TRIS, Web of Science","  - ""Cinahl, PubMed, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, TRIS, and Web of Science.""",,"
The paper states that the systematic searches were performed in the following electronic databases:
""Cinahl, PubMed, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, TRIS, and Web of Science.""
The paper also mentions that manual searches were undertaken of previously published systematic reviews, meta-analyses and authors' personal archives, and the websites of Active Living Research, SUSTRANS, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, Heart Foundation, and Open Grey were also searched for grey literature.

Economic analysis of the health impacts of housing improvement studies: a systematic review,"Elisabeth Fenwick, Catriona Macdonald, Hilary Thomson",-,-,Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health,35,2013,Fenwick_2013.pdf,Not mentioned (no search sources found),"  - ""Forty-five medical and social science databases, as well as websites and grey literature were searched to identify studies of housing improvement which assessed change in any health outcome.""
  - ""45 medical and social science databases, as well as websites and grey literature""",,"
The paper states that the original systematic review searched ""45 medical and social science databases, as well as websites and grey literature"" to identify studies on housing improvement and health outcomes. However, the specific names of the 45 databases are not provided in this paper.
""Forty-five medical and social science databases, as well as websites and grey literature were searched to identify studies of housing improvement which assessed change in any health outcome.""
Since the specific database names are not listed, I cannot provide a list of the search sources. The paper does not appear to contain that level of detail.

Impacts of heat waves and corresponding measures: a review,"Jian Zuo, Stephen Pullen, Jasmine Palmer, Helen Bennetts, Nicholas Chileshe, Tony Ma",-,-,,228,2015,Zuo_2015.pdf,No search sources found,"  - ""As a result, 173 papers and reports were selected to be critically reviewed in this study. Majority of these are sourced from international journals, conference proceedings and books (132); followed by reports from governmental authorities in Australia (19); reports from research institutes (12); and reports from international organizations (10).""
  - ""international journals, conference proceedings and books""",,"
The paper mentions the sources used for the literature review in the following quote:
""As a result, 173 papers and reports were selected to be critically reviewed in this study. Majority of these are sourced from international journals, conference proceedings and books (132); followed by reports from governmental authorities in Australia (19); reports from research institutes (12); and reports from international organizations (10).""
The paper does not provide a specific list of the databases or other sources used to search for the literature. However, it does state that the majority of the sources were from ""international journals, conference proceedings and books"", which suggests that the authors likely searched academic databases and conference proceedings to find relevant literature.

The paper explicitly states the search sources used in the systematic review:
""Two electronic databases have been used in this study, Web of Science and Scopus, chosen for their prevalence in the subject area. Both databases provide abstract and citation information on peer-reviewed papers in the area of physical sciences [23][24][25].""
The paper also mentions that the searches were performed in these two databases:
""The firstgenericset search (A) was performed in September 2013 (Web of Science). The focused set search includes publications available online up to April 2014 (Web of Science þ Scopus).""
Therefore, the search sources used in this systematic review were:

Online engagement for sustainable energy projects: A Systematic review and framework for integration,Danielle Barrios-O'neill,-,-,,32,2016,Barrios-ONeill_2016.pdf,Not mentioned (the names of the 12 databases used in the systematic review are not provided in the paper),"  - ""A total of 12 databases was used resulting in the identification of 147 total studies based on the following inclusion criteria: 1) objectives and outcomes relate to central research question of the review 1""
  - ""1 Please contact the first author for a full list of search terms and databases used.""",,"
The paper states that a total of 12 databases were used in the systematic review, but it does not explicitly list the names of these databases. However, the paper does provide some details about the search strategy:

""A total of 12 databases was used resulting in the identification of 147 total studies based on the following inclusion criteria: 1) objectives and outcomes relate to central research question of the review 1 ;""

""1 Please contact the first author for a full list of search terms and databases used.""

Since the specific database names are not provided in the paper, I cannot confidently list them. The paper indicates that the full list of search terms and databases used is available from the first author upon request.

Relationship between the physical environment and different domains of physical activity in European adults: a systematic review,"Veerle Van Holle, Benedicte Deforche, Jelle Van Cauwenberg, Liesbet Goubert, Lea Maes, Nico Van De Weghe, Ilse De Bourdeaudhuij",-,-,BMC Public Health,314,2012,VanHolle_2012.pdf,"Cinahl, Cochrane, PubMed, SportDiscus, TRIS, Web of Science","  - ""Systematic searches were conducted across six electronic databases: Cinahl, Cochrane, PubMed, SportDiscus, TRIS and Web of Science.""
  - ""In a first stage, the third author (JVC) screened databases until January 2010. In the second stage, an update of electronic database screening was conducted by the first author (VVH), who also performed all subsequent screening steps.""",,"
The paper states that the authors conducted systematic searches across six electronic databases to identify eligible studies:
""Systematic searches were conducted across six electronic databases: Cinahl, Cochrane, PubMed, SportDiscus, TRIS and Web of Science.""
The paper also mentions that the third author (JVC) screened the databases until January 2010, and the first author (VVH) conducted an update of the electronic database screening.
""In a first stage, the third author (JVC) screened databases until January 2010. In the second stage, an update of electronic database screening was conducted by the first author (VVH), who also performed all subsequent screening steps.""
Therefore, the search sources used in this review were:
Cinahl, Cochrane, PubMed, SportDiscus, TRIS, and Web of Science.

The use of climate information to estimate future mortality from high ambient temperature: A systematic literature review,"Michael Sanderson, Katherine Arbuthnott, Sari Kovats, Shakoor Hajat, Pete Falloon",-,-,PLoS ONE,78,2017,Sanderson_2017.pdf,"Web of Science, PubMed/Medline","  - ""electronic databases Web of Science and PubMed/Medline were searched for papers containing a quantitative estimate of future heat-related mortality.""
  - ""The electronic databases Web of Science and PubMed/Medline were searched for papers containing a quantitative estimate of future heat-related mortality.""",,"
The paper states that the ""electronic databases Web of Science and PubMed/Medline were searched for papers containing a quantitative estimate of future heat-related mortality."" This indicates that the two main search sources used in this review were:


""The electronic databases Web of Science and PubMed/Medline were searched for papers containing a quantitative estimate of future heat-related mortality.""


The paper does not mention any other specific search sources, so these two databases appear to be the only ones used.
