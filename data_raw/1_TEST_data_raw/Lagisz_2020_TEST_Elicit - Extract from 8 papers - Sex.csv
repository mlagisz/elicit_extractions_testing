Can the way pigs are handled alter behavioural and physiological measures of affective state?,"Ricard Carreras, Laura Arroyo, Eva Mainau, Daniel Valent, Anna Bassols, Antoni Dalmau, Luigi Faucitano, Xavier Manteca, Antonio Velarde",-,-,Behavioural Processes,16,2017,Carreras2017.pdf,female,"  - ""In this study, 56 female pigs ((Landrace x Large White) x Piétrain) were used.""",,"
The paper explicitly states that the study used female pigs:
""In this study, 56 female pigs ((Landrace x Large White) x Piétrain) were used.""
There is no mention of any male pigs being used in the study. The paper only refers to the pigs as ""female"" throughout.

The paper explicitly states that the study used both female and male pigs:
""A total of 40 entire male and female crossbred pigs (Large White × Landrace), which had previously experienced the same housing and management conditions, were selected at approximately 14 weeks of age and 45 kg live weight.

This quote directly states that the study used both female and male pigs, with each pen containing 5 females and 5 males.
""Pens were located in the same controlled environment, fan ventilated room with the temperature set for 20 • C. Artificial lighting provided at least 40 lx for a period of 11 h per day.""
This quote provides additional details about the housing conditions, but does not mention the sex of the pigs.
""Prior to each trial, pigs were moved in their group through an external walkway from the housing pen to the waiting pen adjacent to the arena, where they remained until it was their turn for testing.""

  - ""A total of 48 pigs, in terms of 12Hal-free gilts (NNG), 12Hal carrier gilts (NnG), and 12Hal-free entire males (NNEM) and 12Hal carrier entire males (NnEM) were put on the CBT at the age of 20 weeks and on the NOT four days later.""",,"
The paper states that the study used both female and male pigs, referred to as ""gilts"" and ""entire males"" respectively:
""A total of 48 pigs, in terms of 12Hal-free gilts (NNG), 12Hal carrier gilts (NnG), and 12Hal-free entire males (NNEM) and 12Hal carrier entire males (NnEM) were put on the CBT at the age of 20 weeks and on the NOT four days later.""

""The proportion of CB classes was not affected by gender (p = 0.278), genotype (p = 0.358) and their interaction (p = 0.560).""
The paper clearly states that both female (gilts) and male (entire males) pigs were used in the study, and that gender did not have a significant effect on the cognitive bias test results.

"Effects of Cage Enrichment on Behavior, Welfare and Outcome Variability in Female Mice","Jeremy D Bailoo, Eimear Murphy, Maria Boada-Saña, Justin A Varholick, Sara Hintze, Caroline Baussière, Kerstin C Hahn, Christine Göpfert, Rupert Palme, Bernhard Voelkl, Hanno Würbel",-,-,Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience,84,2018,Bailoo_2018.pdf,female,"  - ""Subjects were 192 female mice, 96 each of the inbred strain C57BL/6JRj (C57) and the outbred strain RjOrl:SWISS (SWISS) from Janvier Labs, France.""

The paper explicitly states that the study used female mice:

Frontal brain deactivation during a non-verbal cognitive judgement bias test in sheep,"Kathrin Guldimann, Sabine Vögeli, Martin Wolf, Beat Wechsler, Lorenz Gygax",-,-,Brain and Cognition,20,2015,Guldimann2015.pdf,female,"  - ""Twenty-nine female non-lactating and non-gestating Lacaune sheep about 2.5 years of age made up the two groups used in this experiment (Vögeli et al., 2014).""",,"
The paper explicitly states that the study used female non-lactating and non-gestating Lacaune sheep:
""Twenty-nine female non-lactating and non-gestating Lacaune sheep about 2.5 years of age made up the two groups used in this experiment (Vögeli et al., 2014).""
The paper does not mention using any male sheep in the study. Therefore, the sex of the tested animals in the compared groups was female.

The paper states that the study used 8 adult grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) from the Washington State University Bear Research, Education, and Conservation Center. It then provides more details on the bears:
