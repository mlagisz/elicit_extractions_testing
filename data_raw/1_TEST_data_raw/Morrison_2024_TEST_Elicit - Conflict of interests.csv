Behavioral effects of triadimefon in zebrafish are associated with alterations of the dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways,"Susana Paredes-Zúñiga, Nils Trost, Javiera F De La Paz, Julio Alcayaga, Miguel L Allende",-,-,Progress in Neuro-psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry,24,2019,zuniga_2019.pdf,yes,"  - ""Authors declare no conflicts of interest. The founding sponsors had no role in the design of the study; in the collection, analyses, or interpretation of data; in the writing of the manuscript, and in the decision to publish the results.""",,"
To determine the conflict of interests, I will look for a section in the paper that explicitly addresses this. The paper states:
""Authors declare no conflicts of interest. The founding sponsors had no role in the design of the study; in the collection, analyses, or interpretation of data; in the writing of the manuscript, and in the decision to publish the results.""
This quote directly states that the authors declare no conflicts of interest. There is no indication that any conflicts were not declared.
