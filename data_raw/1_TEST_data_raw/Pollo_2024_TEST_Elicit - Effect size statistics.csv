In one study (Wedell and Karlsson 2003), the correlation was between female reproductive output and a measure of spermatophore size. Variation in spermatophore size was, however, generated by mating some males prior to their being used in the experiment and recently mated males produce smaller spermatophores (see Table 1 ). We converted these correlations to Hedges' d using the MetaWin 2.0 calculator (Rosenberg et al. 2000) and setting the sample sizes for the two groups as half the total sample size (Table 2""

The paper does not mention using any other effect size statistics, so the effect size statistic used in this meta-analysis was the standardized mean difference (Hedges' d).

Assortative Mating in Animals,"Yuexin Jiang, Daniel I Bolnick, Mark Kirkpatrick",-,-,American Naturalist,361,2013,Jiang_2013.pdf,correlations,"  - ""For studies that report other effect size metrics (F statistics, x 2 statistics, t statistics, or appropriate descriptive data), we converted these into correlation coefficients using standard methods (Hedges et al. 1985;Cook 1994).""",,"
The paper states that the effect size statistic used in the meta-analysis is the correlation coefficient between mated pairs:
""As our measure for the strength of assortative mating, we used the correlation coefficient for the values of a homologous phenotypic or genotypic trait across members of mated pairs (Wright 1921;Lipsey and Wilson 2001;Redden and Allison 2006).""
The paper also mentions that for studies that reported other effect size metrics, the authors converted them into correlation coefficients:
""For studies that report other effect size metrics (F statistics, x 2 statistics, t statistics, or appropriate descriptive data), we converted these into correlation coefficients using standard methods (Hedges et al. 1985;Cook 1994).""
The paper does not mention using any other effect size statistics besides the correlation coefficient.

The paper states that the effect size statistics used in this meta-analysis were:
""DI and DI s were assessed using the coefficient of variation ratio ""lnCVR,"" defined as the natural logarithm of the ratio between the coefficients of variation from two groups (57). The effect size Db ss was computed as Hedges' d (58), which we converted from t or F statistics used to compare male and female Bateman gradients in the primary studies (59).""
So the effect size statistics used were:
1) lnCVR (log-transformed coefficient of variation ratio) for the sex differences in the opportunity for selection (DI) and the opportunity for sexual selection (DI s).
2) Hedges' d for the sex differences in the Bateman gradient (Db ss).

Measuring and interpreting sexual selection metrics: evaluation and guidelines,"Nils Anthes, Ines K H € Aderer, Nico K Michiels, Tim Janicke",-,-,,41,2017,Anthes_2017.pdf,"mean standardised difference, other","  - ""we computed effect sizes for DI s as the natural logarithm of the ratio between the coefficients of variation in mating success (lnCVR) when using gMS and cMS following Nakagawa et al.

  - ""To test this predicted bias, we extracted male and female estimates of I s and b ss from 28 studies in our meta-analysis data set (cf. section 'Mating success: definition and meaning') that allowed us to include and exclude individuals with zero mating success.

The paper discusses several different effect size statistics used in the analysis:

""We computed effect sizes for DI s as the natural logarithm of the ratio between the coefficients of variation in mating success (lnCVR) when using gMS and cMS following Nakagawa et al. (2015), with higher values indicating that larger estimates were obtained when using gMS.""
This indicates that the authors used the log-transformed ratio of coefficients of variation (lnCVR) as an effect size to compare estimates of the opportunity for sexual selection (I_s) when using genetic mating success (gMS) versus copulatory mating success (cMS).

""Similarly, the effect size for Db ss was defined as Hedges d of the slope difference between the Bateman gradient obtained from using gMS and cMS, with larger values indicating a steeper gradient when using gMS.""
The authors also used Hedges' d, a type of standardized mean difference, to compare the Bateman gradients (b_ss) obtained using gMS versus cMS.

""To test this predicted bias, we extracted male and female estimates of I s and b ss from 28 studies in our meta-analysis data set (cf. section 'Mating success: definition and meaning') that allowed us to include and exclude individuals with zero mating success. We then computed DI s and Db ss , with higher values indicating that the inclusion of individuals with zero mating success yields higher estimates.""
Finally, the authors computed DI_s and Db_ss, which appear to be the log-transformed ratio (lnCVR) and Hedges' d, respectively, to compare estimates of I_s and b_ss when including versus excluding individuals with zero mating success.

  - ""assigned a positive direction to the effect size if it implied that divorce is an adaptive strategy""",,"
The paper states that the authors ""converted all the effect sizes into r, and then into Fisher's Z r for normality, with accompanying SEs"". This indicates that the primary effect size statistic used in the meta-analysis was the correlation coefficient (r) and its Fisher's Z transformation.

This suggests that the effect size statistic used was the correlation coefficient (r), which was transformed to Fisher's Z r for normality. The direction of the effect sizes was assigned based on whether they supported the hypothesis that divorce is an adaptive strategy, particularly for females.

Variation in pre-and post-copulatory sexual selection on male genital size in two species of lygaeid bug,"Liam R Dougherty, David M Shuker",-,-,Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology,18,2016,Dougherty_2016.pdf,"mean standardised difference, other","  - ""The strength of post-copulatory sexual selection on processus length in L. simulans across these different studies was estimated using formal meta-analysis.

The paper discusses using a regression-based approach to measure the strength and shape of sexual selection acting on the length of the male intromittent organ (processus) in two species of lygaeid bug, Lygaeus equestris and Lygaeus simulans. Specifically, the paper mentions using:
""The strength and shape of sexual selection acting on morphological traits were tested using a regression-based approach (Lande and Arnold 1983) using generalised linear models, with mating success or fertilisation success as binary response variables or offspring number (for L. simulans only) as a Gaussian response variable.""
This indicates that the effect size statistics used in the study were:
""Standardised selection gradients (Lande and Arnold 1983;Arnold and Wade 1984) were used to quantify the strength of selection. By standardising in this way, the strength of selection can be compared across multiple studies and standardised selection gradients can be seen as a measure of effect size (Kingsolver et al. 2012).""
The paper also mentions using:
""Standardised estimates of postcopulatory selection on processus length in L. simulans have been published in two previous studies (Tadler 1999;Tadler et al. 1999). Though there were small methodological differences between these studies, there is nevertheless large variation in the strength of selection detected.""
And performing a meta-analysis on these standardised selection gradients:
""The strength of post-copulatory sexual selection on processus length in L. simulans across these different studies was estimated using formal meta-analysis. The variancestandardised linear or quadratic selection gradient was used as the effect size.""
