Can the way pigs are handled alter behavioural and physiological measures of affective state?,"Ricard Carreras, Laura Arroyo, Eva Mainau, Daniel Valent, Anna Bassols, Antoni Dalmau, Luigi Faucitano, Xavier Manteca, Antonio Velarde",-,-,Behavioural Processes,16,2017,Carreras2017.pdf,between,"  - ""The pigs in one of the rooms received positive handling (pH) and the pigs in the other room received negative handling (NH).""",,"
The study design appears to be a between-individual study design, where two groups of pigs were subjected to different handling treatments (positive handling vs. negative handling):
""At 19 weeks of age, pigs in one of the rooms received positive handling (pH) and the pigs in the other room received negative handling (NH).""
""The pH treatment consisted in entering the room slowly and letting the pigs looking at the experimenter with binocular vision before entering the pens. [...] The NH treatment consisted in entering the room quickly and talking loudly.""
""The pigs in one of the rooms received positive handling (pH) and the pigs in the other room received negative handling (NH).""
The paper clearly states that the pigs were divided into two separate rooms, with one group receiving positive handling and the other receiving negative handling. This indicates a between-individual study design, where the two groups were subjected to different treatments simultaneously.

"Does stocking density modify affective state in pigs as assessed by cognitive bias, behavioural and physiological parameters?","Annalisa Scollo, Flaviana Gottardo, Barbara Contiero, Sandra A Edwards",-,-,,61,2014,Scollo2014.pdf,between,"  - ""All experimental procedures and animal care were carried out in accordance with the minimum standards for the protection of pigs laid down by law (Council of The European Union, 2008), and were approved by the Ethical Review Committee of Newcastle University.""
  - ""For the low space allowance treatment k = 0.030, approximating the current European Union minimum standard required (Council of The European Union, 2008). For the high space allowance treatment k = 0.048, according to the recommendation of the Scientific Panel on Animal Health and Welfare of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA AHAW panel, 2005) for permitting the animals to lie in full recumbency.""
  - ""Two pens of pigs were housed at each of two different stocking densities.""",,"
The study design appears to be a between-individual design, where two groups of pigs were housed at different stocking densities and then compared on various measures:
""Two pens of pigs were housed at each of two different stocking densities.""
""For the low space allowance treatment k = 0.030, approximating the current European Union minimum standard required (Council of The European Union, 2008). For the high space allowance treatment k = 0.048, according to the recommendation of the Scientific Panel on Animal Health and Welfare of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA AHAW panel, 2005) for permitting the animals to lie in full recumbency.""
""All experimental procedures and animal care were carried out in accordance with the minimum standards for the protection of pigs laid down by law (Council of The European Union, 2008), and were approved by the Ethical Review Committee of Newcastle University.""
The paper does not mention any within-individual design where the same pigs were subjected to both low and high stocking densities. The study clearly compares two separate groups of pigs under different housing conditions.

Effect of gender and halothane genotype on cognitive bias and its relationship with fear in pigs,"Ricard Carreras, Laura Arroyo, Eva Mainau, Raquel Pe Ña, Anna Bassols, Antoni Dalmau, Luigi Faucitano, Xavier Manteca, Antonio Velarde",-,-,,17,2016,Carreras2016.pdf,between,"  - ""In this study, 48 crossbred pigs (Landrace × Large White sows sired with Piétrain boars) were divided into four groups of 12 pigs each. Each group either consisted of Hal-free gilts, Hal-free entire males (NNG and NNEM), Hal carrier gilts and Hal carrier entire males (NnG and NnEM).""",,"
The study design appears to be a between-individual design, as the paper states that the 48 pigs were divided into four groups of 12 pigs each based on gender (gilts vs. entire males) and halothane genotype (Hal-free vs. Hal carrier):
""In this study, 48 crossbred pigs (Landrace × Large White sows sired with Piétrain boars) were divided into four groups of 12 pigs each. Each group either consisted of Hal-free gilts, Hal-free entire males (NNG and NNEM), Hal carrier gilts and Hal carrier entire males (NnG and NnEM).""
The paper does not mention any within-individual design where the same pigs were subjected to different treatments sequentially. Rather, the different groups were compared to assess the effects of gender and genotype on cognitive bias and fear response.

Frontal brain deactivation during a non-verbal cognitive judgement bias test in sheep,"Kathrin Guldimann, Sabine Vögeli, Martin Wolf, Beat Wechsler, Lorenz Gygax",-,-,Brain and Cognition,20,2015,Guldimann2015.pdf,between,"  - ""To induce a positive mood, 15 sheep were housed in a generous open-front pen with access to an exercise yard on work days between 08:15 and 17:30 h providing a natural daylight rhythm.

  - ""To induce a relatively more negative or more positive mood, the sheep had been subjected to either unpredictable, stimulus-poor or predictable, stimulus-rich housing conditions, respectively, since July 2011 (Vögeli et al., 2014).""",,"
The study design appears to be a between-individual design, where two groups of sheep were subjected to different housing conditions (unpredictable, stimulus-poor vs. predictable, stimulus-rich) to induce differential mood states.
""To induce a relatively more negative or more positive mood, the sheep had been subjected to either unpredictable, stimulus-poor or predictable, stimulus-rich housing conditions, respectively, since July 2011 (Vögeli et al., 2014).""
""To induce a negative mood, a group of 14 sheep was continuously housed in an enclosed deep-litter pen where feed, water and daylight were provided daily at unpredictable times. In contrast to the initial set of conditions, one of the subgroups now received feed at regular feeding times whereas the other subgroup needed to wait a random amount of time up to 2 h until feed was provided.""
""To induce a positive mood, 15 sheep were housed in a generous open-front pen with access to an exercise yard on work days between 08:15 and 17:30 h providing a natural daylight rhythm.

"Measurement of cognitive bias and cortisol levels to evaluate the effects of space restriction on captive collared peccary (Mammalia, Tayassuidae)","Flávia R M Oliveira, Sérgio L G Nogueira-Filho, Maria B C Sousa, Carlos T S Dias, Michael Mendl, Selene S C Nogueira",-,-,,11,2016,Oliveira2016.pdf,within,"  - ""During H4 we introduced two coconuts inside the metabolism pens as temporally unpredictable environmental enrichment, following Nogueira et al. (2011) , who showed that temporal unpredictability increases the exploratory behavior and activity of peccaries.""
  - ""During control conditions (H1, H3, and H5) the animals could freely move around the entire pen (metabolism pen, sheltered area and solarium), while during both space restriction conditions (H2 and H4) the animals were restricted to the metabolism pen only (Fig. 1""
  - ""Following successful training, the peccary were exposed to housing treatments. Each experimental housing condition (H1-H5, detailed below) lasted eight consecutive days and nights, and the judgement bias trial tests occurred on the morning and late afternoon of the eighth day of each condition (Fig. 2 ).

The study design appears to be a within-individual design, where the same group of animals was subjected to different housing conditions sequentially. This can be seen in the following quotes:

""Following successful training, the peccary were exposed to housing treatments. Each experimental housing condition (H1-H5, detailed below) lasted eight consecutive days and nights, and the judgement bias trial tests occurred on the morning and late afternoon of the eighth day of each condition (Fig. 2 ).

This quote indicates that the same animals were exposed to the different housing conditions one after the other.

""During control conditions (H1, H3, and H5) the animals could freely move around the entire pen (metabolism pen, sheltered area and solarium), while during both space restriction conditions (H2 and H4) the animals were restricted to the metabolism pen only (Fig. 1 ).""
This quote further confirms that the same animals were exposed to both the control and space restriction conditions, rather than having separate groups of animals.

""During H4 we introduced two coconuts inside the metabolism pens as temporally unpredictable environmental enrichment, following Nogueira et al. (2011) , who showed that temporal unpredictability increases the exploratory behavior and activity of peccaries.""
This quote also indicates that the same animals were exposed to the space restriction condition with and without environmental enrichment, rather than having separate groups.

To determine the study design, I will look for evidence in the paper of whether the same group of animals was subjected to different housing conditions sequentially (within-individual design) or if there were separate groups of animals subjected to different housing conditions simultaneously (between-individual design).

""In each of the four experiments the animals were divided into the two groups. The length of exposure of each group to different HMs, order of environment exchange and the timeline of behavioural tests is illustrated in Fig. 2 .""
This quote indicates that in each experiment, the animals were divided into two groups that were exposed to different housing manipulations (HM1 and HM2), suggesting a between-individual design.

""During the HM2 the birds still retained the discrimination ability (Fig. 3 , right column) as shown by the significant effect of stimulus (P vs. N) on the proportion of responses in operant discrimination task in all four experiments (Exp1 F 1,20 = 291.09, p < 0.001; Exp2 F 1,45 = 176.35, p < 0.001; Exp3 F 1,35 = 136.81, p < 0.001; Exp4 F 1,85 = 133.96, p < 0.001).""
This quote further confirms that the same birds were tested under both housing conditions, indicating a within-individual design.
