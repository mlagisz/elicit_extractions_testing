  - ""After compiling the relevant studies and dividing them into appropriate groups, information from each paper was summarized as follows. First, in text, important characteristics of each individual study were described, highlighting any limitations and strengths that should be either avoided or emulated in future investigations.""",,"
The paper does not explicitly mention following any specific reporting guideline. There are no quotes that indicate the authors used a predefined reporting guideline or checklist. The paper describes the methods used to identify and summarize the relevant studies, but does not state that they followed a specific reporting guideline.

Human exposure pathways to poly-and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from indoor media: A systematic review,"Nicole M Deluca, Jeffrey M Minucci, Ashley Mullikin, Rachel Slover, Elaine A Cohen Hubal, Adrian Covaci, B S T R A C T",-,-,-,-,-,DeLuca_2022.pdf,no,"  - ""The methods used in this systematic review were previously described in detail in a peer-reviewed protocol (DeLuca et al., 2021) and are based on those described in U.S. EPA's Systematic Review Protocol for the PFBA, PFHxA, PFHxS, PFNA, and PFDA IRIS Assessments (U.S. EPA, 2019) and the Navigation Guide (Woodruff et al., 2011;Woodruff and Sutton, 2014;Johnson et al., 2014;Lam et al., 2016).""",,"
The paper does not explicitly state that it followed a specific reporting guideline. There are no mentions of any reporting guidelines or checklists in the paper. The paper does state that it followed a previously published protocol for the systematic review methodology:
""The methods used in this systematic review were previously described in detail in a peer-reviewed protocol (DeLuca et al., 2021) and are based on those described in U.S. EPA's Systematic Review Protocol for the PFBA, PFHxA, PFHxS, PFNA, and PFDA IRIS Assessments (U.S. EPA, 2019) and the Navigation Guide (Woodruff et al., 2011;Woodruff and Sutton, 2014;Johnson et al., 2014;Lam et al., 2016).""
However, this protocol is for the methodology of conducting the systematic review, not for reporting the results. There is no indication that the authors followed a specific reporting guideline for the systematic review itself.
