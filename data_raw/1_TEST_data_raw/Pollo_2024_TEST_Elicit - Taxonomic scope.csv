The paper examines the effect of male mating history on female reproductive output across multiple Lepidoptera species. This is evident from the following quotes:
""We therefore performed a metaanalysis to explore the effect of male mating history on female reproductive output to ascertain whether a general trend across Lepidoptera species can be detected.""

""We classified species on the basis of mating pattern and taxonomic group (Table 2 ). Species were scored as either Rhopalocera (butterflies and skippers) or Heterocera (moths).""
The paper does not focus on a single species, but rather examines multiple species from the Lepidoptera order, which includes both butterflies/skippers and moths. Therefore, the taxonomic scope of this study is ""multiple species from a specific taxon"".

The paper states that the study focused on a diverse set of animal taxa, not just a single species or a specific taxonomic group:
""We carried out a metaanalysis of published measures of assortative mating for a variety of phenotypic and genotypic traits in a diverse set of animal taxa.""
The paper also mentions that they included species from multiple phyla:
""Our database contains 1,116 measurements of the strength of assortative mating from 254 species in five phyla""
Furthermore, the paper explicitly states that they did not focus on a specific taxonomic group, but rather included a wide range of taxa:
""We excluded studies of assortative mating between incipient species, populations undergoing secondary contact or other forms of hybridization, host races, as well as populations whose conspecific status is ambiguous. Our focus is on the strength of assortment within single populations rather than reproductive isolation between divergent populations or incipient species.""

The paper states that the study synthesized data from 72 studies on 66 animal species, providing estimates of Bateman's parameters for males and females. This indicates that the taxonomic scope of the study was ""multiple species from all taxa"", as it covered a wide range of animal species across the animal kingdom rather than focusing on a single species or a specific taxonomic group.

The paper does not explicitly state the taxonomic scope of the study. However, based on the content, it appears to be focused on multiple species from a specific taxon, rather than a single species or multiple species from all taxa.

The paper discusses various studies on sexual selection metrics, such as the Bateman gradient, across different species. For example, it mentions studies on red-backed spiders, pipefish, rough-skinned newts, and pond snails. This suggests the paper is reviewing the literature on sexual selection metrics across multiple species, rather than focusing on a single species.

The paper states that the study focused on ""24 socially monogamous bird species"" across multiple orders, including Passeriformes, Charadriiformes, Falconiformes, Piciformes, Strigiformes, and Suliformes.

This quote indicates that the study included data from 29 different species across 33 studies. This suggests a ""multiple species from all taxa"" taxonomic scope, as the study was not focused on a specific taxonomic group but rather included a wide range of species.

The taxonomic scope of this study is focused on multiple species from a specific taxon. This can be seen from the following quotes:
""Lygaeus equestris L. and L. simulans Deckert are two closely related species of lygaeid bug (Heteroptera: Lygaeiodea; Lygaeinae).""
""These two species are very closely related and morphologically very similar and were only described as separate species relatively recently (Deckert 1985).""
""Significant differences in genital morphology between closely related species suggest that genital evolution has occurred relatively rapidly.""
The paper specifically focuses on two closely related species of lygaeid bugs, Lygaeus equestris and Lygaeus simulans, rather than a single species or multiple species from all taxa.
