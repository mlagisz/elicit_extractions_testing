The paper mentions that the authors ""consulted scientific literature databases, the Internet and previous reviews on this and related topics"" to compile the data for their meta-analysis. However, it does not explicitly list the specific databases or sources they used. The relevant quote is:

Assortative Mating in Animals,"Yuexin Jiang, Daniel I Bolnick, Mark Kirkpatrick",-,-,American Naturalist,361,2013,Jiang_2013.pdf,"Google Scholar, JSTOR, Web of Science","  - ""searched for publications reporting suitable measures of assortative mating, using keywords searches in multiple databases, including Google Scholar, JSTOR, and Web of Science.""
  - ""examined the reference sections of relevant publications to find additional studies.""",,"
The paper states that the authors ""searched for publications reporting suitable measures of assortative mating, using keywords searches in multiple databases, including Google Scholar, JSTOR, and Web of Science."" This indicates that the main search sources used were:
Google Scholar, JSTOR, and Web of Science
The paper also mentions that the authors ""examined the reference sections of relevant publications to find additional studies."" This suggests they used a secondary search method of checking references of relevant papers.

The paper states that the systematic literature search was conducted using the following sources:
""We first identified relevant studies from ISI Web of Knowledge (Web of Science Core Collection, from 1900 to 2014) with the ""topic"" search terms defined as (""Bateman*"" OR ""opportunit* for selection"" OR ""opportunit* for sexual selection"" OR ""selection gradient*"").

""We added 22 studies to this candidate pool based on downward citation searches using the candidates identified with ISI Web of Knowledge (fig.  S1 ).""
The paper explicitly states that the search sources were ISI Web of Knowledge (Web of Science) and the EvolDir mailing list for gray literature.

Measuring and interpreting sexual selection metrics: evaluation and guidelines,"Nils Anthes, Ines K H € Aderer, Nico K Michiels, Tim Janicke",-,-,,41,2017,Anthes_2017.pdf,Not mentioned (no search sources found),,,"
The paper does not explicitly mention any specific search sources used. There are no quotes that indicate the authors conducted a systematic literature search or used any online databases or other sources to find relevant papers. The paper appears to be a review and discussion of methodological issues in measuring and interpreting sexual selection metrics, rather than a systematic review of the literature.

Mechanisms of Social Influence: A Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Social Information on Female Mate Choice Decisions,"Blake Carlton Jones, Emily H Duval",-,-,Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution,33,2019,Jones_2019.pdf,Web of Science,"  - ""We conducted a meta-analysis of empirical studies quantifying mate-choice copying in non-human animals.

The paper states that the search sources used were:
""We conducted a meta-analysis of empirical studies quantifying mate-choice copying in non-human animals. We identified relevant studies using a topic search in Web of Science (ISI Thomas Reuters) specifying the search criteria as: TS = [(""mate choice"" AND ""copy * "") OR (""mate-choice"" AND ""copy * "") OR ""mate-copy * "" OR ""mate copy * "" OR ""female * copy * ""], targeting peer-reviewed research published between 1900 and May 2019.""
The paper explicitly states that the search was conducted in the Web of Science database.

No evidence of immediate fitness benefits of within-season divorce in monogamous birds,"Antica Culina, Lyanne Brouwer",-,-,Biology Letters,5,2022,Culina_2022.pdf,"The search sources used in this review were: 15 online databases/search platforms, as listed in the electronic supplementary material.","  - ""We conducted a systematic literature search for studies published in English via 15 online databases/search platforms (see electronic supplementary material, Methods) in March 2022.""

  - ""conducted a systematic literature search for studies published in English via 15 online databases/search platforms""",,"
The paper states that the authors ""conducted a systematic literature search for studies published in English via 15 online databases/search platforms"". The specific search sources are listed in the electronic supplementary material, Methods section:

""We conducted a systematic literature search for studies published in English via 15 online databases/search platforms (see electronic supplementary material, Methods) in March 2022.""

The paper does not provide the full list of the 15 search sources in the main text, but directs the reader to the electronic supplementary material for the details:

""The details on the complete syntaxes (used for each database) can be found in the electronic supplementary materials, Methods.""

The relative importance of size and asymmetry in sexual selection,"R Thornhid', A P M0ller, A P Moller",-,-,,87,1998,Thornhill_1998.pdf,Not mentioned (the paper does not provide the specific search sources used in the meta-analysis),"  - ""comprehensive search of the literature and of the Internet""",,"
The paper does not explicitly state the search sources used to find the studies included in the meta-analysis. However, the authors mention that the data set was ""from Møller and Thornhill (1998), which was based on (1) a comprehensive search of the literature and of the Internet for information on the relationship between asymmetry and sexual selection, and (2) correspondence between the authors and behavioral ecologists conducting research on this relationship.""

""The data set used for the present study is from Møller and Thornhill (1998), which was based on (1) a comprehensive search of the literature and of the Internet for information on the relationship between asymmetry and sexual selection, and (2) correspondence between the authors and behavioral ecologists conducting research on this relationship.""

Based on this, the search sources appear to have been a comprehensive literature search and correspondence with researchers in the field, but the specific sources are not listed.

Variation in pre-and post-copulatory sexual selection on male genital size in two species of lygaeid bug,"Liam R Dougherty, David M Shuker",-,-,Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology,18,2016,Dougherty_2016.pdf,Not mentioned (no search sources found),,,"
The paper does not explicitly mention any search sources used. There are no references to any online databases, search engines, or other sources used to find relevant literature for this study. The paper focuses on reporting the results of two experiments conducted by the authors on Lygaeus equestris and Lygaeus simulans, rather than a systematic review of existing literature.
