LIGHT AT NIGHT CANNOT SUPPRESS PINEAL MELATONIN LEVELS IN THE LIZARD ANOLZS CAROLZNENSZS,Herbert Underwcod,-,-,-,-,-,Underwood_1986.pdf,unclear,,,"
To determine the sex of the animals in the study, I will look for any explicit mentions of the sex or gender of the participants in the paper. The paper does not mention the sex of the lizards Anolis carolinensis used in the experiments. There are no quotes that indicate whether the study used male, female, or a mix of both sexes of lizards.
