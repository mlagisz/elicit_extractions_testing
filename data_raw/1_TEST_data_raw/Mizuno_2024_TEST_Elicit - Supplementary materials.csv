Body size affects the evolution of eyespots in caterpillars,"Thomas John Hossie, John Skelhorn, Jesse W Breinholt, Akito Y Kawahara, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,49,2015,Hossie_2015.pdf,yes,,,"
The paper mentions the existence of supplementary materials in several places:
""SI Materials and Methods""
This indicates that there are supplementary materials provided, likely containing additional details about the methods used in the study.
""Figs. S1 and S2""
This suggests that there are supplementary figures included, likely providing additional information or data that could not be fully included in the main text.
""Table S1 and Fig. S3""
This further confirms the presence of supplementary tables and figures.
""Dataset S1""
This indicates that there is also a supplementary dataset provided, likely containing the raw data used in the analyses.

""Here, we present a study on the anti-predation functions of eyespots, addressing two main topics, namely (a) deflective effect of eyespots and (b) the influence of prey detectability on deflective and deterring function of eyespots.""
""We used wild caught blue tits, C. caeruleus, as predators, because they are insectivorous passerines and have been successfully used in previous predation experiments on butterflies and eyespots (e.g., Vallin et al. 2006, 2007).""
""The experimental protocol and housing of birds was reviewed and approved by the regional ethical committee in Linköping (Dnr: 62-08).""

The paper provides a detailed description of the methods, including the experimental setup, training of the birds, and the two experiments conducted. There are no indications that any supplementary materials or additional files were provided.

Eyespots interact with body colour to protect caterpillar-like prey from avian predators,"Thomas John Hossie, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,Animal Behaviour,36,2012,Hossie_2012.pdf,yes,"  - ""A dorsal view of an eyespot caterpillar is provided in Supplementary Fig. S1""

  - ""see Supplementary Table S1 for a summary of possible antipredator functions of eyespots).""
  - ""Supplementary material for this article is available, in the online version, at doi:10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.04.027.""",,"
The paper mentions that there is supplementary material available for this article. This is evident from the following quotes:

""Supplementary material for this article is available, in the online version, at doi:10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.04.027.""
""See Supplementary Table S1 for a summary of possible antipredator functions of eyespots.""
""Insectivorous bird species observed in each of the field locations are detailed in Supplementary Table S2.""
""A dorsal view of an eyespot caterpillar is provided in Supplementary Fig. S1.""

The paper explicitly states that supplementary material is available online, and it also references several supplementary tables and figures within the main text. Therefore, the answer is yes, this paper contains mentions of online supplementary materials.

The paper provides a detailed description of the methods, including the calibration procedures, experimental design, and analysis. The results are also presented comprehensively within the main text. There are no indications that any additional materials are available beyond what is included in the published paper.

Some relevant quotes that support the lack of supplementary materials:
""For all experiments, artificial moth-like stimuli (not designed to mimic any real species) were made from triangular pieces of waterproof card (HP LaserJet Tough Paper; Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA, U.S.A.), 50 mm wide at the base and 25 mm high, printed with specific patterns on a Hewlett Packard LaserJet 4050N printer.""
This quote describes the materials used in detail, without any mention of supplementary information.
""The general methodology for calibrating the grey-scale targets was similar to Stevens et al. (2006) .""
This quote references another publication for the calibration methodology, but does not indicate any supplementary materials are available.
""Survival analysis for all experiments was performed via Cox proportional hazards regression (Cox 1972;Lawless 2002;Klein & Moeschberger 2003), which can accommodate censored data and the nonuniform change in predation risk with respect to time of day.""
The analysis methods are described in detail within the main text, without any mention of supplementary materials.
