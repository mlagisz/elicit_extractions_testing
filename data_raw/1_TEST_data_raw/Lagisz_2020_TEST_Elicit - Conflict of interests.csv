"Does stocking density modify affective state in pigs as assessed by cognitive bias, behavioural and physiological parameters?","Annalisa Scollo, Flaviana Gottardo, Barbara Contiero, Sandra A Edwards",-,-,,61,2014,Scollo2014.pdf,not declared specifically,"  - ""The study was supported by the EU under the Sixth Framework Programme for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration Activities. The content of the paper reflects only the views of the authors and the EU Commission is not liable for any use that may be made of the information contained therein.""",,"
The paper does not explicitly mention any conflict of interest. There are no statements from the authors regarding any potential conflicts of interest. The closest relevant quote is:
""The study was supported by the EU under the Sixth Framework Programme for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration Activities. The content of the paper reflects only the views of the authors and the EU Commission is not liable for any use that may be made of the information contained therein.""
