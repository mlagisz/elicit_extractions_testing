The paper does not explicitly state whether the pigs used in the experiment were captive or wild-caught. However, it provides several details about the source and housing of the pigs that suggest they were captive animals:

""At 9 weeks of age, pigs were transported from a commercial farm to the experimental facilities of IRTA (Monells, Spain) and housed in two rooms of four pens with seven pigs each.""
This quote indicates that the pigs were obtained from a commercial farm, rather than being wild-caught.

""Pens (5 × 2.7 m) had fully slatted floor and were under natural light conditions at a constant environmental temperature (22 ± 3 °C). Each pen was provided with one steel drinker bowl (15 × 16 cm) connected to a nipple and a concrete feeder (58 × 34 cm) with four feeding places. Pigs had water and food ad libitum.""
This description of the pigs' housing conditions, with features like slatted floors, drinker bowls, and feeders, is typical of captive, domesticated pigs rather than wild pigs.

""The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of IRTA.""
The involvement of an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee further suggests that these were captive animals, as wild-caught animals would not typically undergo such oversight.

  - ""had previously experienced the same housing and management conditions,""",,"
The paper states that the study used 40 growing pigs that were ""crossbred Large White × Landrace"" pigs. It also mentions that the pigs ""had previously experienced the same housing and management conditions"". This indicates that the pigs used in the study were captive animals, rather than wild-caught.

""A total of 40 entire male and female crossbred pigs (Large White × Landrace), which had previously experienced the same housing and management conditions, were selected at approximately 14 weeks of age and 45 kg live weight.""
""All experimental procedures and animal care were carried out in accordance with the minimum standards for the protection of pigs laid down by law (Council of The European Union, 2008), and were approved by the Ethical Review Committee of Newcastle University.""

The paper does not mention the pigs being wild-caught, and the details provided suggest they were captive animals raised in a controlled environment.

Effect of gender and halothane genotype on cognitive bias and its relationship with fear in pigs,"Ricard Carreras, Laura Arroyo, Eva Mainau, Raquel Pe Ña, Anna Bassols, Antoni Dalmau, Luigi Faucitano, Xavier Manteca, Antonio Velarde",-,-,,17,2016,Carreras2016.pdf,captive,"  - ""Pigs were inspected daily and no health problems were observed during the experimental period.""
  - ""At 9 weeks of age, pigs were transported from a commercial farm to the experimental facilities of IRTA (Monells, Spain) and housed separately by gender and genotype in 8 pens (6 pigs per pen).""",,"
The paper does not explicitly state whether the pigs used in the experiment were captive or wild-caught. However, it provides some relevant details about the source of the animals:
""At 9 weeks of age, pigs were transported from a commercial farm to the experimental facilities of IRTA (Monells, Spain) and housed separately by gender and genotype in 8 pens (6 pigs per pen).""
This suggests that the pigs were obtained from a commercial farm, rather than being wild-caught. Additionally, the paper mentions that the study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of IRTA, which implies that the pigs were captive animals.
""Pigs were inspected daily and no health problems were observed during the experimental period.""
This further indicates that the pigs were captive animals that were being closely monitored, rather than wild-caught animals.

"Effects of Cage Enrichment on Behavior, Welfare and Outcome Variability in Female Mice","Jeremy D Bailoo, Eimear Murphy, Maria Boada-Saña, Justin A Varholick, Sara Hintze, Caroline Baussière, Kerstin C Hahn, Christine Göpfert, Rupert Palme, Bernhard Voelkl, Hanno Würbel",-,-,Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience,84,2018,Bailoo_2018.pdf,captive,,,"
The paper does not explicitly state whether the mice used in the experiment were captive or wild-caught. However, the information provided suggests that the mice were captive:
Here, using 96 C57BL/6 and SWISS female mice, respectively, we systematically varied environmental enrichment across four levels spanning the range of common enrichment strategies:
This quote indicates that the mice used were from the C57BL/6 and SWISS strains, which are commonly used laboratory mouse strains that are typically captive-bred.
All mice were ear-tattooed for identification by the same two experimenters (JB and EM) on the day following arrival at the laboratory.
This quote suggests that the mice were delivered to the laboratory, implying they were captive-bred animals rather than wild-caught.
Mice were randomly allocated to the four housing conditions, B, N, E and SE, described in further detail in Supplementary Table S1 . They were housed in groups of three per cage, with four replicate cages per strain and treatment in each batch (see Supplementary Table S2 ).
This quote further indicates that the mice were housed in a laboratory setting, which is typical for captive-bred animals used in research.

Frontal brain deactivation during a non-verbal cognitive judgement bias test in sheep,"Kathrin Guldimann, Sabine Vögeli, Martin Wolf, Beat Wechsler, Lorenz Gygax",-,-,Brain and Cognition,20,2015,Guldimann2015.pdf,captive,"  - ""All sheep had permanent access to water.""
  - ""To induce a relatively more negative or more positive mood, the sheep had been subjected to either unpredictable, stimulus-poor or predictable, stimulus-rich housing conditions, respectively, since July 2011 (Vögeli et al., 2014).""
  - ""Twenty-nine female non-lactating and non-gestating Lacaune sheep about 2.5 years of age made up the two groups used in this experiment (Vögeli et al., 2014).""",,"
The paper does not explicitly state whether the sheep used in the experiment were captive or wild-caught. However, it provides some relevant details about the animals:
""Twenty-nine female non-lactating and non-gestating Lacaune sheep about 2.5 years of age made up the two groups used in this experiment (Vögeli et al., 2014).""
This suggests the sheep were captive, as they were specifically selected and housed in groups for the experiment.
""To induce a relatively more negative or more positive mood, the sheep had been subjected to either unpredictable, stimulus-poor or predictable, stimulus-rich housing conditions, respectively, since July 2011 (Vögeli et al., 2014).""
This further indicates the sheep were captive, as they were housed and subjected to experimental conditions over an extended period of time.
""All sheep had permanent access to water.""
This detail about the housing conditions also points to the sheep being captive rather than wild-caught.

"Measurement of cognitive bias and cortisol levels to evaluate the effects of space restriction on captive collared peccary (Mammalia, Tayassuidae)","Flávia R M Oliveira, Sérgio L G Nogueira-Filho, Maria B C Sousa, Carlos T S Dias, Michael Mendl, Selene S C Nogueira",-,-,,11,2016,Oliveira2016.pdf,captive,"  - ""The experimental animals, aged between 4 and 6 years old and weighing 23.0 ± 2.2 kg, were from the same herd (N = 23), born and raised in captive conditions.""",,"
The paper explicitly states that the experimental animals were from the same herd (N = 23), born and raised in captive conditions:
""The experimental animals, aged between 4 and 6 years old and weighing 23.0 ± 2.2 kg, were from the same herd (N = 23), born and raised in captive conditions.""
This indicates that all the animals used in the experiment were captive-born and raised, not wild-caught.

The effects of housing conditions on judgement bias in Japanese quail,"Mária Horváth, Katarína Pichová, L ' Ubor Košt'ál",-,-,,12,2016,Horvàth2016.pdf,captive,"  - ""hatched and reared at the Institute of Animal Biochemistry and Genetics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Ivanka pri Dunaji, Slovak Republic.""
  - ""Female Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) were hatched and reared at the Institute of Animal Biochemistry and Genetics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Ivanka pri Dunaji, Slovak Republic.""",,"
The paper states that the Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) used in the experiments were ""hatched and reared at the Institute of Animal Biochemistry and Genetics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Ivanka pri Dunaji, Slovak Republic."" This indicates that the quail were captive-bred and not wild-caught.
""Female Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) were hatched and reared at the Institute of Animal Biochemistry and Genetics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Ivanka pri Dunaji, Slovak Republic.""
The paper does not mention anything about the quail being wild-caught, and explicitly states they were hatched and reared at the institute, further supporting that they were captive animals.

Validation of a novel cognitive bias task based on difference in quantity of reinforcement for assessing environmental enrichment,"Heidi A Keen, O Lynne Nelson, Charles T Robbins, Marc Evans, David J Shepherdson, Ruth C Newberry",-,-,-,-,-,Keen2014.pdf,captive,"  - ""Bears were fed two meals daily (primarily dry dog food pellets and apples) providing approximately 30 % of ad libitum intake, which was typical for non-lactating adult bears in the facility during spring and summer (McGowan et al. 2010), and gained some additional nutrients from foraging in the yard.""
  - ""Bears were housed in pairs in 32-m 2 indoor/outdoor concretefloored enclosures equipped with a hanging tire for enrichment and given daily access to a 0.81-ha semi-natural exercise yard, climbing frame, wooden logs, and water bath, with other socially compatible individuals.""
  - ""Eight adult grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) from the Washington State University Bear Research, Education, and Conservation Center participated in this study.""",,"
The paper states that the study was conducted using captive grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) from the Washington State University Bear Research, Education, and Conservation Center:
""Eight adult grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) from the Washington State University Bear Research, Education, and Conservation Center participated in this study.""
The paper also provides details on the housing and care of the bears, indicating they were captive animals:
""Bears were housed in pairs in 32-m 2 indoor/outdoor concrete-floored enclosures equipped with a hanging tire for enrichment and given daily access to a 0.81-ha semi-natural exercise yard, climbing frame, wooden logs, and water bath, with other socially compatible individuals.""
""Bears were fed two meals daily (primarily dry dog food pellets and apples) providing approximately 30 % of ad libitum intake, which was typical for non-lactating adult bears in the facility during spring and summer (McGowan et al. 2010), and gained some additional nutrients from foraging in the yard.""
The paper does not mention any of the bears being wild-caught, and provides details indicating they were captive animals housed and cared for at the research facility.
