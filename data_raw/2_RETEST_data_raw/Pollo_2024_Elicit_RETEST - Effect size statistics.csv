Assortative Mating in Animals,"Yuexin Jiang, Daniel I Bolnick, Mark Kirkpatrick",-,-,American Naturalist,363,2013,Jiang_2013.pdf,correlations,"  - ""For studies that report other effect size metrics (F statistics, x 2 statistics, t statistics, or appropriate descriptive data), we converted these into correlation coefficients using standard methods (Hedges et al. 1985;Cook 1994).""",,"
The paper states that the effect size statistic used in the meta-analysis is the correlation coefficient between mated pairs:
""As our measure for the strength of assortative mating, we used the correlation coefficient for the values of a homologous phenotypic or genotypic trait across members of mated pairs (Wright 1921;Lipsey and Wilson 2001;Redden and Allison 2006).""
The paper also mentions that for studies that report other effect size metrics, the authors converted them into correlation coefficients:
""For studies that report other effect size metrics (F statistics, x 2 statistics, t statistics, or appropriate descriptive data), we converted these into correlation coefficients using standard methods (Hedges et al. 1985;Cook 1994).""
Therefore, the primary effect size statistic used in this meta-analysis is the correlation coefficient between mated pairs.

The paper describes using three different effect size statistics to measure sex differences in sexual selection:

""DI and DI s were assessed using the coefficient of variation ratio ""lnCVR,"" defined as the natural logarithm of the ratio between the coefficients of variation from two groups (57).""
This indicates that the effect size statistic DI and DI_s are log-transformed coefficient of variation ratios (lnCVR).

""The effect size Db ss was computed as Hedges' d (58), which we converted from t or F statistics used to compare male and female Bateman gradients in the primary studies (59).""
This indicates that the effect size statistic Db_ss is Hedges' d, which is a mean standardized difference.

""All effect sizes were highly correlated with each other (Spearman correlation: DI versus DI s : r = 0.661, P < 0.001, K = 76; DI versus Db ss : r = 0.768, K = 73, P < 0.001; Db ss versus DI s : r = 0.484, K = 68, P < 0.001; fig. S2).""
The high correlations between the different effect size statistics suggest they are measuring related but distinct aspects of sexual selection.

Measuring and interpreting sexual selection metrics: evaluation and guidelines,"Nils Anthes, Ines K H € Aderer, Nico K Michiels, Tim Janicke",-,-,,41,2017,Anthes_2017.pdf,"mean standardised difference, other","  - ""we computed effect sizes for DI s as the natural logarithm of the ratio between the coefficients of variation in mating success (lnCVR) when using gMS and cMS following Nakagawa et al.

  - ""Similarly, the effect size for Db ss was defined as Hedges d of the slope difference between the Bateman gradient obtained from using gMS and cMS, with larger values indicating a steeper gradient when using gMS.""",,"
The paper discusses several different effect size statistics used in the analysis:

""We computed effect sizes for DI s as the natural logarithm of the ratio between the coefficients of variation in mating success (lnCVR) when using gMS and cMS following Nakagawa et al. (2015), with higher values indicating that larger estimates were obtained when using gMS.""
This indicates that the authors used the log-transformed ratio of coefficients of variation (lnCVR) as an effect size to compare estimates of the opportunity for sexual selection (I_s) when using genetic mating success (gMS) versus copulatory mating success (cMS).

""Similarly, the effect size for Db ss was defined as Hedges d of the slope difference between the Bateman gradient obtained from using gMS and cMS, with larger values indicating a steeper gradient when using gMS.""
The authors also used Hedges' d, a type of standardized mean difference, to compare the Bateman gradients (b_ss) obtained using gMS versus cMS.

""To test this predicted bias, we extracted male and female estimates of I s and b ss from 28 studies in our meta-analysis data set (cf. section 'Mating success: definition and meaning') that allowed us to include and exclude individuals with zero mating success. We then computed DI s and Db ss , with higher values indicating that the inclusion of individuals with zero mating success yields higher estimates.""
Finally, the authors computed DI_s and Db_ss, which appear to be the log-transformed ratio (lnCVR) and Hedges' d, respectively, to compare estimates of I_s and b_ss when including versus excluding individuals with zero mating success.

The paper explicitly states that the effect size statistic used in the meta-analysis was the odds ratio (OR):

The paper also mentions that the natural log of the OR [ln(OR)] was used to normalize the distribution of the data:

The paper further explains that the variance [V ln(OR)] and sampling error [SE ln(OR)] of the ln(OR) were calculated for each experiment.
""We calculated variance [V ln(OR) ] and sampling error [SE ln(OR) ] of the ln (OR) of each experiment with the follow equations:""
Therefore, the effect size statistic used in this meta-analysis was the odds ratio (OR) and its natural log transformation (ln(OR)).
