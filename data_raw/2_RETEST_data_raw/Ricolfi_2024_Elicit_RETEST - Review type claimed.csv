ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANT EXPOSURES AND PRETERM BIRTH: A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW,"Kelly K Ferguson, Marie S O'neill, John D Meeker",-,-,"Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health. Part B, Critical Reviews",146,2013,Ferguson_2013.pdf,Comprehensive review,,,"
The authors claim that this is a ""comprehensive review"" of the literature on environmental contaminant exposures and preterm birth. This is evident from the following quotes:
This is a comprehensive review of all known studies published from 1992 through August 2012 linking maternal exposure to environmental chemicals during pregnancy with preterm birth.
In order to provide a comprehensive summary of the studies of preterm birth and environmental chemicals to date, a list of exposures of interest was first compiled from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Fourth National Exposure Report (CDC, 2009).
After compiling the relevant studies and dividing them into appropriate groups, information from each paper was summarized as follows.
