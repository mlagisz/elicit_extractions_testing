Neurobehavioral Impairments Caused by Developmental Imidacloprid Exposure in Zebrafish,"Emily B Crosby, Jordan M Bailey, Anthony N Oliveri, Edward D Levin",-,-,Neurotoxicology and Teratology,145,2015,crosby_2015.pdf,imidacloprid,,,"
The pesticide investigated in this study is imidacloprid, a neonicotinoid insecticide. This is evident from the following quotes:
Neonicotinoids are widely used and quite effective for control of sucking-insects on crops and for flea control on cats and dogs (Schenker et al., 2003). Like nicotine, the efficacy of neonicotinoids as pesticides (and therefore as neurotoxicants) comes from their ability to act as agonists at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, an action they have in insects and mammals alike (Tomizawa & Casida, 2000;Tomizawa et al., 1995;Sheets, 2002).
An effective and widely used neonicotinoid pesticide is imidacloprid (1-(6-chloro-3-pyridylmethyl)-N-nitro-imidazolidin-2-ylideneamine) (Sheets, 2012).
The goal of the present study was to investigate behavioral endpoints across the lifespan, with larval, adolescent and adult testing times. We used two zebrafish strains (AB* and 5D) for larval assessments. For adolescent and adult assessments we used the type of zebrafish most frequently described in the literature, the AB* strain.

"Tributyltin enhanced anxiety of adult male zebrafish through elevating cortisol level and disruption in serotonin, dopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid neurotransmitter pathways","Xin Tu, Ying-Wen Li, Qi-Liang Chen, Yan-Jun Shen, Zhi-Hao Liu",-,-,Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,36,2020,tu_2020.pdf,Tributyltin (TBT),,,"
The paper clearly states that the pesticide investigated is tributyltin (TBT), an organotin compound. This is evident from the following quotes:
Tributyltin (TBT), a widely used organotin compounds, has been applied to many industrial usages, for instance the antifouling paint and agricultural pesticides (BLABER, 1970;Takahashi, 2009;Gipperth, 2009).
To investigate the disruption of TBT on fish anxiety and the mechanisms possibly involved, adult male zebrafish (Danio rerio) were treated with TBT (100 and 500 ng/L) for 28 days and anxiety behavior was further investigated using a novel tank dive test.
Tributyltin chloride (TBT-Cl, CAS No. 1461-22-9, Cat No. 45713-250 MG) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (USA) and its purity is higher than 96%.

Zebrafish provide a sensitive model of persisting neurobehavioral effects of developmental chlorpyrifos exposure: Comparison with nicotine and pilocarpine effects and relationship to dopamine deficits,"Donnie Eddins, Daniel Cerutti, Paul Williams, Elwood Linney, Edward D Levin",-,-,Neurotoxicology and Teratology,232,2010,eddins_2010.pdf,chlorpyrifos,,,"
The pesticide investigated in this study is chlorpyrifos (CPF). This is evident from the following quotes:
Chlorpyrifos (CPF) an organophosphate pesticide causes persisting behavioral dysfunction in rat models when exposure is during early development.
The organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) has been one of the most widely used insecticides in the world [14].
This set of experiments examined the persisting effects of early developmental exposure (0-5 dfp) to CPF on later (2 months of age) neurobehavioral function (startle response).
The paper clearly states that the pesticide investigated is chlorpyrifos (CPF), an organophosphate insecticide.
