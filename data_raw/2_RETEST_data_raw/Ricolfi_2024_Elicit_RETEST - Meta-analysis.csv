Association between maternal exposure to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances and risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Zhuoma Deji, Peng Liu, Xin Wang, Xin Zhang, Yuehua Luo, Zhenzhen Huang",-,-,Science of the Total Environment,39,2021,Deji_2021.pdf,yes,"  - ""A random-effects model meta-analysis was performed to calculate pooled effect estimates and investigate the associations between PFASs and miscarriage, stillbirth or preterm birth.""
  - ""We reported pooled data with ORs, mostly used in studies with different designs, populations and lengths of follow-up, and their 95% CIs, while other effect sizes were transformed into ORs. HRs were roughly considered equivalent to RRs which were calculated from ORs using the following formula: RR = OR/[1 -P 0 × (1 -OR)], where P 0 is the risk of the outcome of interest occurred in the whole participants (Buawangpong et al., 2020). To assess heterogeneity across studies, forest plots and standard cut-offs for I 2 statistic were used. The I 2 values of 25%, 50%, and 75% were considered as low, medium, and high heterogeneity, respectively. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed to investigate the causes of heterogeneity.""",,"
The paper clearly states that it includes a meta-analysis:
""A random-effects model meta-analysis was performed to calculate pooled effect estimates and investigate the associations between PFASs and miscarriage, stillbirth or preterm birth.""
The paper also provides details on the meta-analysis methodology:
""We reported pooled data with ORs, mostly used in studies with different designs, populations and lengths of follow-up, and their 95% CIs, while other effect sizes were transformed into ORs.

The paper also presents the results of the meta-analysis in detail, including forest plots and pooled effect estimates.

"Early-Life Exposure to Per-and Poly-Fluorinated Alkyl Substances and Growth, Adiposity, and Puberty in Children: A Systematic Review","Yun Jeong Lee, Hae Woon, Hwa Young Kim, Yoon-Jung Choi, Young Ah Lee, Alberto Mantovani",-,-,Frontiers in Endocrinology,54,2021,Lee_2021.pdf,no,"  - ""We performed a systematic review of the epidemiologic literature to assess the effects of earlylife PFAS exposure on prenatal and postnatal growth, adiposity, and puberty in children and adolescents.""",,"
The paper states that it performed a systematic review of the epidemiologic literature, but does not mention conducting a meta-analysis. The paper states:
""We performed a systematic review of the epidemiologic literature to assess the effects of earlylife PFAS exposure on prenatal and postnatal growth, adiposity, and puberty in children and adolescents.""
The paper also mentions two previous meta-analyses that were conducted on the effects of PFAS on birth weight:
""Two recent meta-analyses of 16 and 24 studies (69,70), found decreases in birth weight of 12.8 g (69) and 10.5 g (70) with 1 ng/ml increases in PFOA in maternal and cord blood, respectively. For PFOS, a meta-analysis of nine studies showed a 0.9 g decrease in birth weight per 1 ng/ml increases in maternal PFOS exposures (69).""
However, the current paper itself does not appear to have conducted a meta-analysis. The paper focuses on summarizing the findings from the individual studies reviewed, rather than providing a quantitative synthesis across studies.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANT EXPOSURES AND PRETERM BIRTH: A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW,"Kelly K Ferguson, Marie S O'neill, John D Meeker",-,-,"Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health. Part B, Critical Reviews",146,2013,Ferguson_2013.pdf,no,"  - ""Finally, in forest plots, odds ratios (OR) observed for each study were displayed by environmental exposure to provide a visual depiction of the existing data (Neyeloff et al., 2012).

  - ""Grellier and colleagues (2010) concluded that based on the existing literature there was insufficient evidence to indicate an association between THM exposure and any birth outcome, including preterm birth.

  - ""After compiling the relevant studies and dividing them into appropriate groups, information from each paper was summarized as follows. First, in text, important characteristics of each individual study were described, highlighting any limitations and strengths that should be either avoided or emulated in future investigations.""",,"
The review by Ferguson et al. (2013) does not include a meta-analysis. This can be determined from the following quotes:

""After compiling the relevant studies and dividing them into appropriate groups, information from each paper was summarized as follows. First, in text, important characteristics of each individual study were described, highlighting any limitations and strengths that should be either avoided or emulated in future investigations.""
The review focuses on summarizing and describing the individual studies, rather than conducting a quantitative meta-analysis.

The review includes forest plots to visually display the odds ratios from individual studies, but does not perform a formal meta-analysis to combine the results.

""Grellier and colleagues (2010) concluded that based on the existing literature there was insufficient evidence to indicate an association between THM exposure and any birth outcome, including preterm birth.

The review does reference a previous meta-analysis by Grellier et al. (2010), but does not conduct a new meta-analysis as part of this review.

Human exposure pathways to poly-and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from indoor media: A systematic review,"Nicole M Deluca, Jeffrey M Minucci, Ashley Mullikin, Rachel Slover, Elaine A Cohen Hubal, Adrian Covaci, B S T R A C T",-,-,-,-,-,DeLuca_2022.pdf,no,"  - ""Results of evidence synthesis are also not considered robust where weighted medians for some sensitivity studies were calculated using only two data points.""
  - ""Additional uncertainty in the study is derived from the estimation of parameters in exposure equations, such as the elimination rate, which is still an active area of research for PFAS chemicals.""",,"
The paper does not appear to include a meta-analysis. The paper states that ""Due to the limited number of studies included in the review, evidence maps were not produced from literature inventory summaries as was anticipated in the protocol."" This suggests that the authors did not have enough studies to perform a quantitative meta-analysis.

  - ""Instead, we chose to synthesise the various effect sizes by vote counting the positive and negative effect directions (McKenzie and Brennan, 2022).""",,"
The paper states that the authors considered performing a meta-analysis but found it to be unfeasible due to the substantial heterogeneity in the statistical analyses used across the different studies:
""Consequently, most of the effect sizes were not directly comparable with one another and it might be misleading to pool them together (McKenzie and Brennan, 2022). Our decision not to pool the effect sizes concurred with that of a recent review by (Kirk et al., 2018) who similarly did not consider their findings on the associations between PFAS exposure and lipid profiles suitable for meta-analysis.""
The paper further explains that the authors chose to synthesize the findings by vote counting the positive and negative effect directions instead:
