Body size affects the evolution of eyespots in caterpillars,"Thomas John Hossie, John Skelhorn, Jesse W Breinholt, Akito Y Kawahara, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,49,2015,Hossie_2015.pdf,yes,,,"
The paper mentions the existence of supplementary materials in several places:
""SI Materials and Methods""
This indicates that there are supplementary materials provided, likely containing additional details about the methods used in the study.
""Figs. S1 and S2""
This suggests that there are supplementary figures included, likely providing additional information or data that could not be fully included in the main text.
""Table S1 and Fig. S3""
This further confirms the presence of supplementary tables and figures that are referenced in the main text.

Deflective effect and the effect of prey detectability on anti-predator function of eyespots,"Adrian Vallin, Marina Dimitrova, Ullasa Kodandaramaiah, Sami Merilaita, D Kemp",-,-,Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology,37,2011,Vallin_2011.pdf,no,"  - ""The experimental protocol and housing of birds was reviewed and approved by the regional ethical committee in Linköping (Dnr: 62-08).""
  - ""We used wild caught blue tits, C. caeruleus, as predators, because they are insectivorous passerines and have been successfully used in previous predation experiments on butterflies and eyespots (e.g., Vallin et al. 2006Vallin et al. , 2007)).""
  - ""Here, we present a study on the anti-predation functions of eyespots, addressing two main topics, namely (a) deflective effect of eyespots and (b) the influence of prey detectability on deflective and deterring function of eyespots.""",,"
The paper does not mention any supplementary materials or additional files. There are no references to any online supplementary materials, appendices, or additional files that contain further details about the methods, data, or code used in the study.

Eyespots interact with body colour to protect caterpillar-like prey from avian predators,"Thomas John Hossie, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,Animal Behaviour,36,2012,Hossie_2012.pdf,yes,"  - ""A dorsal view of an eyespot caterpillar is provided in Supplementary Fig. S1""

  - ""Supplementary material for this article is available, in the online version, at doi:10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.04.027.""",,"
The paper mentions that there is supplementary material available for this article. This is evident from the following quotes:

""Supplementary material for this article is available, in the online version, at doi:10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.04.027.""
""See Supplementary Table S1 for a summary of possible antipredator functions of eyespots.""
""Insectivorous bird species observed in each of the field locations are detailed in Supplementary Table S2.""
""A dorsal view of an eyespot caterpillar is provided in Supplementary Fig. S1.""

The paper explicitly states that supplementary material is available online, and it also references several supplementary tables and figures within the main text. Therefore, the answer is yes, this paper contains mentions of online supplementary materials.

Field experiments on the effectiveness of 'eyespots' as predator deterrents,"Martin Stevens, Elinor Hopkins, William Hinde, Amabel Adcock, Yvonne Connolly, Tom Troscianko, Innes C Cuthill, K T Troscianko",-,-,-,-,-,Stevens_2007.pdf,no,"  - ""For all experiments, artificial moth-like stimuli (not designed to mimic any real species) were made from triangular pieces of waterproof card (HP LaserJet Tough Paper; Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA, U.S.A.), 50 mm wide at the base and 25 mm high, printed with specific patterns on a Hewlett Packard LaserJet 4050N printer.""

The paper does not mention any supplementary materials or additional files. There are no references to any online supplementary materials, appendices, or additional files that contain further details about the methods, data, or other information related to the experiments.

The paper provides a detailed description of the methods, including the calibration procedures, experimental design, and analysis. The results are also presented in detail, with figures showing the survival curves for the different treatments. There are no indications that any additional materials are available beyond what is included in the main paper.

Some relevant quotes that support the lack of supplementary materials:
""For all experiments, artificial moth-like stimuli (not designed to mimic any real species) were made from triangular pieces of waterproof card (HP LaserJet Tough Paper; Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA, U.S.A.), 50 mm wide at the base and 25 mm high, printed with specific patterns on a Hewlett Packard LaserJet 4050N printer.""
This quote describes the materials used in detail, without any mention of supplementary information.
""The general methodology for calibrating the grey-scale targets was similar to Stevens et al. (2006) .""
This quote references another publication for the calibration methodology, but does not indicate any supplementary materials are available.
""Survival analysis for all experiments was performed via Cox proportional hazards regression (Cox 1972;Lawless 2002;Klein & Moeschberger 2003), which can accommodate censored data and the nonuniform change in predation risk with respect to time of day.""
The analysis methods are described in detail in the paper, without any mention of supplementary materials.

The Feeding Behaviour of Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) in the Presence of 'Eyes',"I R Inglis, L W Huson, M B Marshall, P A Arid,  Neville",-,-,-,-,-,Inglis_1983.pdf,no,"  - ""All observations were made from the adjoining room which housed the timers and relays that controlled the presentation motor.""
  - ""The entire apparatus was housed in a small room which was maintained at 15'C and h.td a 12 h on-12 h off light regime.""",,"
The paper does not mention any supplementary materials or additional files. There are no references to any online supplementary materials, appendices, or additional files throughout the paper. The paper appears to be self-contained without any external supplementary information.


""The entire apparatus was housed in a small room which was maintained at 15'C and h.td a 12 h on-12 h off light regime."" (Methods section)
""All observations were made from the adjoining room which housed the timers and relays that controlled the presentation motor."" (Methods section)
""The four test stimuli were a) a blank card; b) two crosses arranged horizontally 6 cm apart, each measuring 2 x~ 2 cm; c) two triangular eyes arranged 6 cm apart, each consisting of an equilateral trianslc having sides 2 c m long and containing a black triangular 'pupil'; d) two circular eyes arranged 6 cm apart, each consisting of a circle of 2 cm diameter containing 1 cm diameter black 'pupil'."" (Methods section)


No


The paper does not mention or reference any supplementary materials, appendices, or additional files. The methods section provides detailed descriptions of the experimental apparatus and stimuli used, indicating the paper is self-contained without any external supplementary information. Based on the lack of any references to supplementary materials, I am highly confident the paper does not contain any.
