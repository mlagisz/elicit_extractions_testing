Built environmental correlates of older adults' total physical activity and walking: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"David W Barnett, Anthony Barnett, Andrea Nathan, Jelle Van Cauwenberg, Ester Cerin",-,-,-,-,-,Barnett_2017.pdf,"systematic review, meta-analysis","  - ""systematic review and meta-analysis""
  - ""This systematic review and meta-analysis was registered in PROSPERO (Registration no. CRD42016051227 [38]) in November 2016.""
  - ""Due to the large range of different environmental and PA measures reported in the selected articles, it was not possible to conduct a 'traditional' meta-analysis involving the estimation of pooled effect sizes and their 95% confidence intervals. Hence, to quantitatively synthesise the findings, a meta-analytic approach was applied to define conservative estimates of p-values for each examined combination of environmental attribute and PA outcome [27].""

The paper states that it is a ""systematic review of the economic analysis of the health impacts of housing improvement studies"":
""This paper presents the results of this review, providing details of the cost and economic analyses reported alongside housing intervention studies and accompanying health impacts.""
The paper also mentions that it is building on a previous systematic review on the health impacts of housing improvement:
""Given the growing desire of policy makers to demonstrate value for money from interventions, we undertook a further review of these studies to identify and extract data which could be used to inform estimates of the relative costs and benefits of housing improvement, and illustrate the challenges of economic evaluation in this field.""
""All housing intervention studies and their associated papers included in the 2009 systematic review of the health impacts of housing improvement 14 were examined for reports of costs and economic analyses.""
Based on these quotes, the review type is a systematic review, as it systematically examines the existing literature on the economic analysis of housing improvement studies.

The paper claims to be a ""critical and systematic review of the effects of heat waves and mechanisms to mitigate their effects"". This is evident from the following quotes:
""Hence it is timely to undertake a critical and systematic review of the effects of heat waves and mechanisms to mitigate their effects.""
""This paper reports on a critical literature review which covers the following main aspects: (1) the definition of heat waves; (2) the impacts of heat waves on health, ecosystems and the built environment; (3) the current mechanisms to deal with impacts of heat waves.""
""The aim of this research is to present a critical review of impacts of heat waves and corresponding mechanisms.""
The paper does not mention conducting a meta-analysis or meta-regression. Therefore, the review type is a systematic review.

The paper states that it used a Narrative Synthesis (NS) framework for the systematic review:

""This study was carried out according to a Narrative Synthesis (NS) framework using a process developed originally by Popay et al. [52] and further refined by Roen et al. [2], Arai et al. [3], and Rodgers et al. [53]. NS is a method of systematic review enabling investigation of research questions with potentially broad informing subject areas [52].""

The paper also mentions that NS was selected because it ""relies primarily on textual description to summarise findings of multiple types of studies, and can involve mapping these against a conceptual framework [38].""

""NS consists of three steps designed to ensure optimal transparency and robustness; these are developing a theory of change, developing a preliminary synthesis, exploring relationships within and between studies, and assessing the robustness of the synthesis [3].""

The paper does not mention conducting any meta-analysis or meta-regression. Therefore, the review type is a systematic review, not a meta-analysis.
