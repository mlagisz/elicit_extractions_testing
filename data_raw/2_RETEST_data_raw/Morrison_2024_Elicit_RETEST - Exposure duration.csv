""For the investigation of cypermethrin potential to induce behavioural abnormalities, five adult zebrafish per treatment group (control and 25 μg/L cypermethrin) were used per trial. The trials were repeated more than three times on different days (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Briefly, adult zebrafish of mixed gender were randomly selected from their housing tank and gently transferred to two tanks viz. the control tank containing no cypermethrin and the treatment tank containing 25 μg/L of cypermethrin as final concentration. Fishes were exposed for 30 min in their respective treatment tanks and then individually transferred to the behavioural imaging setup as described earlier (Nema et al., 2016).""
