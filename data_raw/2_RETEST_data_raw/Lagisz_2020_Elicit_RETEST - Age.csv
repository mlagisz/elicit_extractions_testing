Can the way pigs are handled alter behavioural and physiological measures of affective state?,"Ricard Carreras, Laura Arroyo, Eva Mainau, Daniel Valent, Anna Bassols, Antoni Dalmau, Luigi Faucitano, Xavier Manteca, Antonio Velarde",-,-,Behavioural Processes,16,2017,Carreras2017.pdf,juvenile,"  - ""Treatments started when pigs aged 19 weeks and lasted until 27 weeks of age (slaughter age)""
  - ""In this study, 56 female pigs ((Landrace x Large White) x Piétrain) were used. At 9 weeks of age, pigs were transported from a commercial farm to the experimental facilities of IRTA (Monells, Spain) and housed in two rooms of four pens with seven pigs each.""",,"
The paper provides information about the age of the pigs used in the experiment:
""In this study, 56 female pigs ((Landrace x Large White) x Piétrain) were used. At 9 weeks of age, pigs were transported from a commercial farm to the experimental facilities of IRTA (Monells, Spain) and housed in two rooms of four pens with seven pigs each.""
This quote indicates that the pigs were 9 weeks old when they were transported to the experimental facilities.
""Treatments started when pigs aged 19 weeks and lasted until 27 weeks of age (slaughter age)""
This quote specifies that the pigs were between 19 and 27 weeks of age during the experimental treatments.
Based on these quotes, the pigs used in the experiment were juvenile, as they were not sexually mature or close to sexual maturity at the start of the experiment (9 weeks old) and were slaughtered at 27 weeks of age, which is still before full sexual maturity.

"Does stocking density modify affective state in pigs as assessed by cognitive bias, behavioural and physiological parameters?","Annalisa Scollo, Flaviana Gottardo, Barbara Contiero, Sandra A Edwards",-,-,,62,2014,Scollo2014.pdf,juvenile,"  - ""All experimental procedures and animal care were carried out in accordance with the minimum standards for the protection of pigs laid down by law (Council of The European Union, 2008), and were approved by the Ethical Review Committee of Newcastle University.""
  - ""A total of 40 entire male and female crossbred pigs (Large White × Landrace), which had previously experienced the same housing and management conditions, were selected at approximately 14 weeks of age and 45 kg live weight.""",,"
The paper does not explicitly state the age of the pigs used in the experiment. However, it does provide some information that can be used to infer the age:
""A total of 40 entire male and female crossbred pigs (Large White × Landrace), which had previously experienced the same housing and management conditions, were selected at approximately 14 weeks of age and 45 kg live weight.""
This quote indicates that the pigs were approximately 14 weeks old at the start of the experiment. Pigs typically reach sexual maturity around 5-6 months of age. Since the pigs in this study were 14 weeks old, they would not be considered sexually mature or close to sexual maturity. 
""All experimental procedures and animal care were carried out in accordance with the minimum standards for the protection of pigs laid down by law (Council of The European Union, 2008), and were approved by the Ethical Review Committee of Newcastle University.""
This quote suggests that the pigs were juveniles, as the experiment followed guidelines for the protection of juvenile pigs.

Effect of gender and halothane genotype on cognitive bias and its relationship with fear in pigs,"Ricard Carreras, Laura Arroyo, Eva Mainau, Raquel Pe Ña, Anna Bassols, Antoni Dalmau, Luigi Faucitano, Xavier Manteca, Antonio Velarde",-,-,,17,2016,Carreras2016.pdf,juvenile,"  - ""At 19 weeks of age, pigs were trained and tested individually for the CB according to the methodology described by Carreras et al. (2015).""
  - ""At 9 weeks of age, pigs were transported from a commercial farm to the experimental facilities of IRTA (Monells, Spain) and housed separately by gender and genotype in 8 pens (6 pigs per pen).""",,"
The paper states that the pigs were transported to the experimental facilities at 9 weeks of age and the cognitive bias test was performed at 19 weeks of age. This indicates that the pigs were juvenile animals, as they were not sexually mature at the time of the experiment.
""At 9 weeks of age, pigs were transported from a commercial farm to the experimental facilities of IRTA (Monells, Spain) and housed separately by gender and genotype in 8 pens (6 pigs per pen).""
""At 19 weeks of age, pigs were trained and tested individually for the CB according to the methodology described by Carreras et al. (2015).""
The paper does not provide any information about the pigs being close to sexual maturity or sexually mature, so there is no evidence to suggest they were adult animals.

"Effects of Cage Enrichment on Behavior, Welfare and Outcome Variability in Female Mice","Jeremy D Bailoo, Eimear Murphy, Maria Boada-Saña, Justin A Varholick, Sara Hintze, Caroline Baussière, Kerstin C Hahn, Christine Göpfert, Rupert Palme, Bernhard Voelkl, Hanno Würbel",-,-,Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience,85,2018,Bailoo_2018.pdf,juvenile,"  - ""Animals were kept on a reversed 12:12 light/dark cycle with lights on at 19:00 h.""
  - ""Subjects were 192 female mice, 96 each of the inbred strain C57BL/6JRj (C57) and the outbred strain RjOrl:SWISS (SWISS) from Janvier Labs, France. Each batch was comprised of 48 newly weaned non-sibling mice (21-25 days old at delivery) per strain.""",,"
The paper does not explicitly state the age of the mice used in the experiment. However, it does provide some relevant information:
""Subjects were 192 female mice, 96 each of the inbred strain C57BL/6JRj (C57) and the outbred strain RjOrl:SWISS (SWISS) from Janvier Labs, France. Each batch was comprised of 48 newly weaned non-sibling mice (21-25 days old at delivery) per strain.""
This quote indicates that the mice were newly weaned, which suggests they were juvenile mice, not yet sexually mature. The paper also states that the mice were 21-25 days old at delivery, which is within the juvenile age range for mice.
""Animals were kept on a reversed 12:12 light/dark cycle with lights on at 19:00 h.""
This quote provides additional context that the mice were likely still in the juvenile stage, as they were kept on a reversed light/dark cycle, which is common for laboratory mice experiments.

The paper does not explicitly state the age of the animals used in the experiment. However, it provides some relevant information:
""Twenty-nine female non-lactating and non-gestating Lacaune sheep about 2.5 years of age made up the two groups used in this experiment (Vögeli et al., 2014).""
This quote indicates that the sheep used in the experiment were around 2.5 years old, which would classify them as adult animals.
""To induce a relatively more negative or more positive mood, the sheep had been subjected to either unpredictable, stimulus-poor or predictable, stimulus-rich housing conditions, respectively, since July 2011 (Vögeli et al., 2014).""
This quote suggests that the sheep had been in the housing conditions for over 2 years, further supporting that they were adult animals at the time of the experiment.
""With one exception, these focal sheep had been involved in a series of experiments in which they were exposed to different sets of stimuli thought to induce emotional reactions (Vögeli, Wolf, Wechsler, & Gygax, unpublished results; Vögeli et al., 2014) and in a previous cognitive judgement bias test (Vögeli et al., 2014).""
This quote indicates that the focal sheep had been involved in previous experiments, suggesting they were not juveniles.

  - ""Female Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) were hatched and reared at the Institute of Animal Biochemistry and Genetics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Ivanka pri Dunaji, Slovak Republic.""",,"
The paper does not explicitly state the age of the Japanese quail used in the experiments. However, it does provide some relevant information:
""Female Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) were hatched and reared at the Institute of Animal Biochemistry and Genetics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Ivanka pri Dunaji, Slovak Republic.""
This suggests that the quail were likely juveniles, as they were hatched and reared for the experiments, rather than using adult quail.
""The quails were group housed in wire cages with floor space 5620 cm 2 (maximum 12 birds per cage). During the housing manipulation part of birds was housed in deep litter pens. The deep litter pen had floor space 7870 cm 2 . Its floor was covered with wood shavings, and the birds were provided with nipple drinkers and feeders.""
The fact that the quail were group housed in cages and pens with wood shavings, drinkers, and feeders also suggests they were likely juveniles, as these housing conditions are more typical for rearing young birds rather than housing mature adults.
