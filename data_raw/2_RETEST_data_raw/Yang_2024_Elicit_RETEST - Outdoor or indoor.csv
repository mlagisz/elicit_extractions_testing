The paper indicates that the study was conducted in both outdoor and indoor environments:
""Adult male weaver birds were captured from nature and acclimatized in an outdoor aviary (size = 3 × 2.5 × 2.5 m) under natural photoperiod until beginning of the experiment. Thereafter, they were transferred to indoor aviary under 8 hr light: 16 hr dark (short photoperiod; 8L:16D).""
The birds were first captured from the wild and acclimatized in an outdoor aviary. Then, they were transferred to an indoor aviary for the actual experiment under controlled light-dark conditions.
""Photosensitive birds (n = 33) were individually housed in specially designed activity cages (60 × 35 × 45 cm) that were placed individually in temperature-regulated (24 ± 2 • C) light-proof wooden chambers (75 × 50 × 70 cm) providing programmed light:dark cycles by compact fluorescent lamps (CFL; 14 W, 230 V, Phillips, India).""
The actual experiment was conducted in these indoor, temperature-controlled, light-proof chambers, indicating an indoor study.

Can skyglow reduce nocturnal melatonin concentrations in Eurasian perch? *,"Franziska Kupprat, Franz H € Olker, Werner Kloas, Sarah Harmon",-,-,Environmental Pollution,38,2020,Kupprat_2020.pdf,indoor,"  - ""The entire experiment was repeated once with a new set of fish directly after the first run to achieve a sufficient amount of replicates for each treatment (n ¼ 6).

  - ""Juvenile Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) were obtained from Lake Müggelsee (Berlin, Germany) and kept in indoor tanks (ca. 600 L) with natural photoperiod and dark nights for at least two weeks prior to moving into the aquaria of the experimental setup.""
  - ""Twelve equal aquaria with 80 L tap water were set up in a climate chamber at ca. 17 C (see below for more details).""",,"
The paper describes an indoor, laboratory-based experiment on Eurasian perch. This can be determined from the following quotes:
""Twelve equal aquaria with 80 L tap water were set up in a climate chamber at ca. 17 C (see below for more details).""
This quote indicates that the experiment was conducted in a climate-controlled indoor setting, specifically in aquaria within a climate chamber.
""Juvenile Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) were obtained from Lake Müggelsee (Berlin, Germany) and kept in indoor tanks (ca. 600 L) with natural photoperiod and dark nights for at least two weeks prior to moving into the aquaria of the experimental setup.""
This quote further confirms that the fish were kept in indoor tanks prior to the experiment, and then moved to the experimental aquaria within the climate chamber.
""The entire experiment was repeated once with a new set of fish directly after the first run to achieve a sufficient amount of replicates for each treatment (n ¼ 6). Hence, there was about a month in between the temporal replication. The experiments were run in October and November 2017.""
This quote indicates that the experiment was conducted over multiple runs in an indoor, controlled setting, rather than an outdoor, field-based study.

The paper indicates that this was an indoor study, as the animals were captured from the wild and then housed in the laboratory for the experiments. This is evident from the following quotes:
""Adult male Indian palm squirrel, Funambulus pennantii (diurnal, n = 30) weighing 120 ± 5 g, captured from the campus of Banaras Hindu University (Lat. 25°18ʹN; Long. 83°1ʹE) and adult albino mice of AKR strain (nocturnal, n = 30), 3-to 4-months old weighing 30 ± 5 g from a breeding colony maintained at Department of Zoology, Banaras Hindu University were used in this study.""

LIGHT AT NIGHT CANNOT SUPPRESS PINEAL MELATONIN LEVELS IN THE LIZARD ANOLZS CAROLZNENSZS,Herbert Underwcod,-,-,-,-,-,Underwood_1986.pdf,"indoor, outdoor","  - ""Freshly collected anoles were placed under stockroom conditions on 26 June 1985.

To determine whether the study by Herbert Underwood was conducted outdoors or indoors, I will examine the details provided in the paper:

""Freshly collected anoles were placed under stockroom conditions on 26 June 1985. On 5 July 1985, groups of lizards were placed in boxes in the environmental room under identical conditions as described for experiment 1 for 14 days.""
This quote indicates that the lizards were initially kept in stockroom conditions, and then placed in boxes in an environmental room for the experiments.

""Freshly collected anoles were placed under stockroom conditions on 26 July 1985. On 2 August 1985 lizards were placed in terraria in one of two 'C' chambers in the Phytotron on the NCSU campus.""
This quote further clarifies that the lizards were placed in terraria in 'C' chambers in the Phytotron, which is an indoor facility.

""To avoid heat stress the sun-exposed lizards were misted at 10 min intervals.""
This quote suggests that the sun-exposure experiments were conducted outdoors, as the need to mist the lizards to avoid heat stress implies an outdoor environment.

Based on the information provided in the paper, this appears to be an indoor study. The paper states that the ""Lizards held in individual containers were acclimated for 12-14 days in photothermally programmable environment chambers as described previously [22]."" This indicates that the experiments were conducted in a controlled laboratory environment, not in an outdoor setting.

Therefore, this appears to be an indoor study, even though the animals were originally obtained from the outdoor, natural environment.
