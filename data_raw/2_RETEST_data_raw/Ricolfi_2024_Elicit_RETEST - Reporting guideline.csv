Association between maternal exposure to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances and risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Zhuoma Deji, Peng Liu, Xin Wang, Xin Zhang, Yuehua Luo, Zhenzhen Huang",-,-,Science of the Total Environment,39,2021,Deji_2021.pdf,yes,"  - ""The systematic review and meta-analysis was performed according to the general principles recommended in the Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology consensus statement and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) criteria (Fig. 1 ) (Ziegler et al., 2011).""
  - ""The inclusion criteria of studies that eligible for meta-analysis were:

(1) original observational studies, such as case-control, cross-sectional or cohort studies; (2) the participants of interest of the studies were pregnant women; (3) studies that measured exposures to PFASs (PFOS, PFOA, and so on) in biological samples such as blood, from either pregnant women or the umbilical cord; (4) studies that presented pregnancy outcomes as miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm birth, pregnancy loss;

(5) studies that gave the quantitative estimates on the associations between PFASs exposure and adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as OR, relative risk (RR), or hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).""
  - ""According to the PRISMA guidelines, a total of 1438 articles were identified from three databases, among which 1201 were excluded after preliminary screening (unrelated to study topic or duplicates).""",,"
The paper states that the systematic review and meta-analysis was performed according to the general principles recommended in the Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) consensus statement and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) criteria:

"Early-Life Exposure to Per-and Poly-Fluorinated Alkyl Substances and Growth, Adiposity, and Puberty in Children: A Systematic Review","Yun Jeong Lee, Hae Woon, Hwa Young Kim, Yoon-Jung Choi, Young Ah Lee, Alberto Mantovani",-,-,Frontiers in Endocrinology,54,2021,Lee_2021.pdf,yes,"  - ""reported according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines""

The paper states that this systematic review was ""reported according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines"":
""This systematic review was reported according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines (14).""
The PRISMA guidelines are a widely used reporting guideline for systematic reviews and meta-analyses, so the authors of this paper explicitly state that they followed this reporting guideline.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANT EXPOSURES AND PRETERM BIRTH: A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW,"Kelly K Ferguson, Marie S O'neill, John D Meeker",-,-,"Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health. Part B, Critical Reviews",146,2013,Ferguson_2013.pdf,no,"  - ""After compiling the relevant studies and dividing them into appropriate groups, information from each paper was summarized as follows. First, in text, important characteristics of each individual study were described, highlighting any limitations and strengths that should be either avoided or emulated in future investigations.""
  - ""Second, tables were created listing key characteristics of studies within each grouping. Finally, in forest plots, odds ratios (OR) observed for each study were displayed by environmental exposure to provide a visual depiction of the existing data (Neyeloff et al., 2012).""
  - ""Studies were divided into broader categories, including POP, drinking-water contaminants, atmospheric pollutants, metals and metalloids, and other environmental contaminants.""",,"
The paper does not explicitly state that it followed a specific reporting guideline. There are no mentions of the authors using a predefined checklist or guideline for reporting the review. However, the paper does describe the methods used to conduct the review in detail:

Human exposure pathways to poly-and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from indoor media: A systematic review,"Nicole M Deluca, Jeffrey M Minucci, Ashley Mullikin, Rachel Slover, Elaine A Cohen Hubal, Adrian Covaci, B S T R A C T",-,-,-,-,-,DeLuca_2022.pdf,no,"  - ""The methods used in this systematic review were previously described in detail in a peer-reviewed protocol (DeLuca et al., 2021) and are based on those described in U.S. EPA's Systematic Review Protocol for the PFBA, PFHxA, PFHxS, PFNA, and PFDA IRIS Assessments (U.S. EPA, 2019) and the Navigation Guide (Woodruff et al., 2011;Woodruff and Sutton, 2014;Johnson et al., 2014;Lam et al., 2016).""
  - ""This systematic review adapted existing tools and methodologies to investigate the importance of PFAS exposure pathways from indoor and residential media including consumer products, household articles, cleaning products, personal care products, and indoor air and dust.""
  - ""existing systematic review tools and methodologies""",,"
The paper does not explicitly state that it followed a specific reporting guideline. However, the authors do mention that they adapted ""existing systematic review tools and methodologies"" and followed a previously published protocol for their systematic review methodology:

""This systematic review adapted existing tools and methodologies to investigate the importance of PFAS exposure pathways from indoor and residential media including consumer products, household articles, cleaning products, personal care products, and indoor air and dust.""

""The methods used in this systematic review were previously described in detail in a peer-reviewed protocol (DeLuca et al., 2021) and are based on those described in U.S. EPA's Systematic Review Protocol for the PFBA, PFHxA, PFHxS, PFNA, and PFDA IRIS Assessments (U.S. EPA, 2019) and the Navigation Guide (Woodruff et al., 2011;Woodruff and Sutton, 2014;Johnson et al., 2014;Lam et al., 2016).""

The authors do not mention following a specific reporting guideline like PRISMA or MOOSE. The focus appears to be on the systematic review methodology rather than reporting guidelines.

The paper does not explicitly mention following any specific reporting guideline. There are no statements in the paper indicating that the authors followed a predefined reporting guideline or checklist. The paper does state the criteria used for selecting the articles to be included in the review:

""The selection of articles for this review was carried out according to the following relevant points: i) a complete description of the matrices, like geographical localization, collection, and storage of samples; ii) an adequate number of analyzed samples, according to the type of the sample (the amount depends on the sample type); iii) analytical methods described with appropriate quality control (QA/QC) methodology.

""We took reference from the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement throughout the process (Liberati et al., 2009).""
This indicates that the authors followed the PRISMA reporting guideline for systematic reviews. The paper also mentions using the STROBE checklist to assess the reporting quality of the included studies:
""We assessed the reporting quality and methodology quality of the reviewed articles using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist (Members of the STROBE Initiative, 2021) and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHBLI) Study Quality Assessment Tool (National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, 2021), respectively.""

  - ""This is a scoping literature review [14], which summarizes epidemiological studies on the associations of ADHD and HBM4EU priority substances, or their possible associations, which justify further research.""",,"
The paper does not explicitly state that it followed a specific reporting guideline. The authors mention that this is a ""scoping review"" rather than a systematic review, and they note that the ""literature searches were not conducted in a manner that fulfilled the criteria of a systematic review."" This suggests that the authors did not follow a specific reporting guideline like PRISMA for systematic reviews.
""This is a scoping literature review [14], which summarizes epidemiological studies on the associations of ADHD and HBM4EU priority substances, or their possible associations, which justify further research.""
