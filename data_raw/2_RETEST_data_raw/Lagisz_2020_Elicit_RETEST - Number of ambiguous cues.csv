Can the way pigs are handled alter behavioural and physiological measures of affective state?,"Ricard Carreras, Laura Arroyo, Eva Mainau, Daniel Valent, Anna Bassols, Antoni Dalmau, Luigi Faucitano, Xavier Manteca, Antonio Velarde",-,-,Behavioural Processes,16,2017,Carreras2017.pdf,yes,"  - ""At the end of the reminder sessions, each pig was individually subjected to the CBT where a bucket containing two pieces of chopped apple that were accessible by the pig was placed in the middle of the pen. The test ended once the pig had finished eating the chopped apples or 90 s after the pig had entered the test pen. The latency to contact the bucket was recorded as in the previous sessions.""",,"
The paper states that in the cognitive bias test (CBT), pigs were trained to discriminate between a bucket with or without access to chopped apples, which were the positive and negative cues, respectively. The paper does not explicitly state the number of different ambiguous cues used in the CBT, but it does provide details on the test procedure:

""At the end of the reminder sessions, each pig was individually subjected to the CBT where a bucket containing two pieces of chopped apple that were accessible by the pig was placed in the middle of the pen. The test ended once the pig had finished eating the chopped apples or 90 s after the pig had entered the test pen. The latency to contact the bucket was recorded as in the previous sessions.""

This indicates that there was only one ambiguous cue used in the CBT - the bucket containing the chopped apples, which was placed in the middle of the pen. The paper does not mention any other ambiguous cues being used.

"Does stocking density modify affective state in pigs as assessed by cognitive bias, behavioural and physiological parameters?","Annalisa Scollo, Flaviana Gottardo, Barbara Contiero, Sandra A Edwards",-,-,,62,2014,Scollo2014.pdf,yes,"  - ""During the testing days, the animals of the tested batch were individually exposed once per day to each of the three ambiguous probe locations (near rewarded: NR; middle: M; near unrewarded: NU), spread within a pseudorandom sequence of the two reference locations.""",,"
The paper states that during the testing phase, the animals were exposed to three ambiguous probe locations:
""During the testing days, the animals of the tested batch were individually exposed once per day to each of the three ambiguous probe locations (near rewarded: NR; middle: M; near unrewarded: NU), spread within a pseudorandom sequence of the two reference locations.""
The paper clearly indicates that there were three different ambiguous probe locations used in the judgement bias trials.

Effect of gender and halothane genotype on cognitive bias and its relationship with fear in pigs,"Ricard Carreras, Laura Arroyo, Eva Mainau, Raquel Pe Ña, Anna Bassols, Antoni Dalmau, Luigi Faucitano, Xavier Manteca, Antonio Velarde",-,-,,17,2016,Carreras2016.pdf,yes,"  - ""After the reminder sessions, each pig was individually subjected to a CBT that finished when the pig ate the chopped apples or 90 s after the pig had entered the test pen.""
  - ""At 19 weeks of age, pigs were trained and tested individually for the CB according to the methodology described by Carreras et al. (2015). Twelve training sessions were performed, 6 with access and 6 without access to chopped apples (A and NA sessions, respectively).""",,"
The paper does not explicitly state the ""Number of ambiguous cues"" used in the cognitive bias test. However, it does provide details on the training and testing procedure:

""At 19 weeks of age, pigs were trained and tested individually for the CB according to the methodology described by Carreras et al. (2015). Twelve training sessions were performed, 6 with access and 6 without access to chopped apples (A and NA sessions, respectively).""
This indicates that there were two types of cues used during the training sessions - one with access to food (A) and one without access to food (NA).

""After the reminder sessions, each pig was individually subjected to a CBT that finished when the pig ate the chopped apples or 90 s after the pig had entered the test pen.""
During the actual cognitive bias test (CBT), the pigs were presented with a single ambiguous cue, which was the bucket containing the chopped apples.

Therefore, the ""Number of ambiguous cues"" used in the judgement bias trials was 1.

"Effects of Cage Enrichment on Behavior, Welfare and Outcome Variability in Female Mice","Jeremy D Bailoo, Eimear Murphy, Maria Boada-Saña, Justin A Varholick, Sara Hintze, Caroline Baussière, Kerstin C Hahn, Christine Göpfert, Rupert Palme, Bernhard Voelkl, Hanno Würbel",-,-,Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience,85,2018,Bailoo_2018.pdf,yes,,,"
To determine the number of ambiguous cues used in the judgment bias task, I will look for relevant quotes in the paper:
To assess judgment biases, we developed a task which integrates active trial initiation into a spatial Go/No Go task (see Supplementary Figure S6 ). Each apparatus consisted of a rectangular arena with a row of nine goal-holes at one end (five of which were used for this task), and a trapezoid-shaped area containing a nosepoke at the opposite end.
This quote indicates that the task used 5 goal-holes, which would correspond to 5 ambiguous cues.
Once animals had learned this discrimination, ambiguous test trials with open goal-holes at three equidistant intermediate locations between the extreme ends, were interspersed among Go and No-Go trials, across six test sessions.
This quote further confirms that there were 3 ambiguous cues used in the judgment bias task.

Frontal brain deactivation during a non-verbal cognitive judgement bias test in sheep,"Kathrin Guldimann, Sabine Vögeli, Martin Wolf, Beat Wechsler, Lorenz Gygax",-,-,Brain and Cognition,20,2015,Guldimann2015.pdf,yes,"  - ""three ambiguous locations were presented.""
  - ""The sequence of the box locations was chosen at random, and each sheep was tested with a different sequence.""
  - ""The ambiguous box positions were at a relative distance of 30% (at 0.9 m), 50% (at 1.5 m) and 70% (at 2.1 m) between the positions of the positively and the negatively reinforced boxes.""
  - ""In the test phase, sheep went through one session with five trials. In addition to the negatively and positively reinforced box locations in each corner of the testing area, three ambiguous locations were presented.""",,"
The paper states that in the test phase, in addition to the negatively and positively reinforced box locations, ""three ambiguous locations were presented."" This indicates that there were 3 different ambiguous cues used in the judgement bias trials.

"Measurement of cognitive bias and cortisol levels to evaluate the effects of space restriction on captive collared peccary (Mammalia, Tayassuidae)","Flávia R M Oliveira, Sérgio L G Nogueira-Filho, Maria B C Sousa, Carlos T S Dias, Michael Mendl, Selene S C Nogueira",-,-,,11,2016,Oliveira2016.pdf,yes,"  - ""In judgement bias tests a 3 s 'ambiguous' auditory cue -a drumstick hitting an aluminum plate, CS A (Freq average 6 kHz; 62.8 dB) was presented to the animals.""",,"
The paper states that the researchers used a single ""ambiguous"" auditory cue during the judgement bias trials:
""In judgement bias tests a 3 s 'ambiguous' auditory cue -a drumstick hitting an aluminum plate, CS A (Freq average 6 kHz; 62.8 dB) was presented to the animals.""
The paper does not mention using any other ambiguous cues. The researchers specifically state that they used a single ""ambiguous"" cue, rather than multiple ambiguous cues.

The paper states that in the judgement bias tests, in addition to the two cues used in discrimination training (positive and negative), the hens were exposed to three ambiguous cues:

The paper states that there were 3 intermediate shades of gray used as ambiguous probe stimuli in the cognitive bias task:
