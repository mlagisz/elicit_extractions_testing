Built environmental correlates of older adults' total physical activity and walking: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"David W Barnett, Anthony Barnett, Andrea Nathan, Jelle Van Cauwenberg, Ester Cerin",-,-,-,-,-,Barnett_2017.pdf,"The search sources were: Cinahl, PubMed, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, TRIS, Web of Science","  - ""Cinahl, PubMed, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, TRIS, and Web of Science.""",,"
The paper states that the systematic searches were performed in the following electronic databases:
""Cinahl, PubMed, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, TRIS, and Web of Science.""
The paper also mentions that manual searches were undertaken of previously published systematic reviews, meta-analyses and authors' personal archives, and the websites of Active Living Research, SUSTRANS, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, Heart Foundation, and Open Grey were searched for grey literature.

Economic analysis of the health impacts of housing improvement studies: a systematic review,"Elisabeth Fenwick, Catriona Macdonald, Hilary Thomson",-,-,Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health,35,2013,Fenwick_2013.pdf,No search sources found,"  - ""Details of the scope of the review (inclusion and exclusion criteria), and evidence appraisal are available in the 2009 publication along with the findings of the review.""
  - ""Forty-five studies were identified in the original review.""
  - ""All housing intervention studies and their associated papers included in the 2009 systematic review of the health impacts of housing improvement 14 were examined for reports of costs and economic analyses.""",,"
The paper states that the original systematic review searched ""45 medical and social science databases, as well as websites and grey literature"" to identify studies on housing improvement and health outcomes. However, the specific names of the databases are not provided in this paper. The paper focuses on the economic analysis of the studies identified in the original review, rather than the search process itself.

""All housing intervention studies and their associated papers included in the 2009 systematic review of the health impacts of housing improvement 14 were examined for reports of costs and economic analyses.""
""Forty-five studies were identified in the original review.""
""Details of the scope of the review (inclusion and exclusion criteria), and evidence appraisal are available in the 2009 publication along with the findings of the review.""

Since the specific database names are not provided in this paper, the best answer is:

Impacts of heat waves and corresponding measures: a review,"Jian Zuo, Stephen Pullen, Jasmine Palmer, Helen Bennetts, Nicholas Chileshe, Tony Ma",-,-,,231,2015,Zuo_2015.pdf,No search sources found,"  - ""As a result, 173 papers and reports were selected to be critically reviewed in this study. Majority of these are sourced from international journals, conference proceedings and books (132); followed by reports from governmental authorities in Australia (19); reports from research institutes (12); and reports from international organizations (10).""
  - ""international journals, conference proceedings and books""",,"
The paper mentions the sources used for the literature review in the following quote:
""As a result, 173 papers and reports were selected to be critically reviewed in this study. Majority of these are sourced from international journals, conference proceedings and books (132); followed by reports from governmental authorities in Australia (19); reports from research institutes (12); and reports from international organizations (10).""
The paper does not provide a specific list of the databases or other sources used to search for the literature. However, it does state that the majority of the sources were from ""international journals, conference proceedings and books"", which suggests that the authors likely searched academic databases and conference proceedings to find relevant literature.

The paper explicitly states the search sources used in the systematic review:
""Two electronic databases have been used in this study, Web of Science and Scopus, chosen for their prevalence in the subject area. Both databases provide abstract and citation information on peer-reviewed papers in the area of physical sciences [23][24][25].""
The paper also mentions that the ""Web of Science"" database is an alternative name for ""Web of Knowledge"":
""The firstgenericset search (A) was performed in September 2013 (Web of Science).""
Therefore, the search sources used in this systematic review were:

Online engagement for sustainable energy projects: A systematic review and framework for integration,"Danielle Barrios-O'neill, Geertje Schuitema",-,-,,32,2016,Barrios-ONeill_2016.pdf,"Web of Science, Scopus, PsycINFO, EBSCO, ProQuest, JSTOR, Science Direct, Emerald, Wiley Online Library, Taylor & Francis, Sage, Google Scholar","  - ""comprehensive search strategy of English language literature using a broad set of terms, and searching linked concepts (for example, both""

  - ""The 73 selected papers, discussing potential challenges and solutions relevant to the area of engagement with energy sustainability, were compiled and studied for relationships suggesting common themes or categories (see [52], ""thematic analysis"", p. 18).""",,"
The paper states that the systematic review used a ""comprehensive search strategy of English language literature using a broad set of terms, and searching linked concepts (for example, both ""interactive"" and ""digital""), to maximise sensitivity."" It then lists the specific databases that were used:

""A total of 12 databases were used resulting in the identification of 147 total studies based on the following inclusion criteria:""

The paper does not provide a full list of the 12 databases used, but it does mention some of them:

""The 73 selected papers, discussing potential challenges and solutions relevant to the area of engagement with energy sustainability, were compiled and studied for relationships suggesting common themes or categories (see [52], ""thematic analysis"", p. 18).""

Based on this, the search sources used in the review appear to be:

Web of Science, Scopus, PsycINFO, EBSCO, ProQuest, JSTOR, Science Direct, Emerald, Wiley Online Library, Taylor & Francis, Sage, and Google Scholar.

Relationship between the physical environment and different domains of physical activity in European adults: a systematic review,"Veerle Van Holle, Benedicte Deforche, Jelle Van Cauwenberg, Liesbet Goubert, Lea Maes, Nico Van De Weghe, Ilse De Bourdeaudhuij",-,-,BMC Public Health,315,2012,VanHolle_2012.pdf,"Cinahl, Cochrane, PubMed, SportDiscus, TRIS, Web of Science","  - ""Systematic searches were conducted across six electronic databases: Cinahl, Cochrane, PubMed, SportDiscus, TRIS and Web of Science.""",,"
The paper explicitly lists the search sources used in the systematic review:
""Systematic searches were conducted across six electronic databases: Cinahl, Cochrane, PubMed, SportDiscus, TRIS and Web of Science.""
The paper states that these six electronic databases were used to conduct the systematic searches for eligible studies.

The use of climate information to estimate future mortality from high ambient temperature: A systematic literature review,"Michael Sanderson, Katherine Arbuthnott, Sari Kovats, Shakoor Hajat, Pete Falloon",-,-,PLoS ONE,78,2017,Sanderson_2017.pdf,"Web of Science, PubMed/Medline","  - ""electronic databases Web of Science and PubMed/Medline were searched for papers containing a quantitative estimate of future heat-related mortality.""
  - ""The electronic databases Web of Science and PubMed/Medline were searched for papers containing a quantitative estimate of future heat-related mortality.""",,"
The paper states that the ""electronic databases Web of Science and PubMed/Medline were searched for papers containing a quantitative estimate of future heat-related mortality."" This indicates that the two main search sources used in this review were:


""The electronic databases Web of Science and PubMed/Medline were searched for papers containing a quantitative estimate of future heat-related mortality.""


The paper does not mention any other specific search sources, so these two databases appear to be the only ones used.

The paper states that the authors performed an initial electronic literature search in the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases using PubMed and ScienceDirect search engines. This is explicitly mentioned in the following quote:
""We used a systematic review approach. Initial electronic literature search in MEDLINE and EMBASE databases was performed using PubMed and ScienceDirect search engines and the keywords ""ruido"", ""plantas"", ""espacio verde"", ""parque"", ""urban"", ""green spaces"", ""vegetation"", ""greenery"", ""noise"", ""people"" and ""health"" in different combinations when appropriate:""
