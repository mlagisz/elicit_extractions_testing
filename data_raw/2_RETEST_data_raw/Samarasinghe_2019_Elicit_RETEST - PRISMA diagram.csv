The paper does not appear to contain a PRISMA-like diagram that illustrates the process of searching and screening the literature. The paper states that ""All available data on costs and, where available, details of any economic analysis were extracted by one reviewer (CM) and checked by a second reviewer (EF or HT)."" However, it does not provide a visual diagram showing the flow of studies through the screening and selection process.

The paper does not mention or present a PRISMA diagram. There are no quotes or sections in the paper that describe or illustrate a PRISMA diagram or a similar flow diagram of the literature search and screening process.

The paper states the following about the methodology:

These keywords include: extreme weather conditions; heat waves; hot spell; health; overheating; mechanisms; building, etc. As a result, 173 papers and reports were selected to be critically reviewed in this study.""
However, there is no further detail or diagram provided about the specific search and screening process.

The paper does not present a PRISMA diagram or similar flow diagram of the literature search and screening process.

The paper does not mention or present a PRISMA diagram, and the description of the methodology does not indicate that such a diagram was used. The paper simply states that a list of keywords was used to search for related papers and reports, and 173 were selected for review, but there are no further details provided about the specific search and screening process. Therefore, based on the information provided in the paper, it is clear that a PRISMA diagram was not presented.

Latent heat storage in building elements: A systematic review on properties and contextual performance factors,"A Mavrigiannaki, E Ampatzi",-,-,,78,2016,Mavrigiannaki_2016.pdf,yes,"  - ""Following the review, 20 papers were identified as inappropriate for data extraction and were excluded from the analysis.""
  - ""The preliminary search revealed that a little more than 1/3 of the tracked literature was related to LHS applications in buildings. Around 1/6th of these was on PCMs integration in building elements and was selected for review, along with the results that came out of the second search set.""

The paper does present a PRISMA-like diagram that illustrates the process of searching and screening the literature. This can be seen in Figure 1 of the paper, which is titled ""Summary of the search process"".


""Fig. 1 depicts a summary of the search process.""
""The preliminary search revealed that a little more than 1/3 of the tracked literature was related to LHS applications in buildings. Around 1/6th of these was on PCMs integration in building elements and was selected for review, along with the results that came out of the second search set.""
""Following the review, 20 papers were identified as inappropriate for data extraction and were excluded from the analysis.""


The diagram shows the number of studies identified through the initial broad search, the number that were related to LHS applications in buildings, the number specifically on PCM integration in building elements, and the number that were ultimately included in the review after further filtering.

Online engagement for sustainable energy projects: A systematic review and framework for integration,"Danielle Barrios-O'neill, Geertje Schuitema",-,-,,32,2016,Barrios-ONeill_2016.pdf,no,"  - ""To illustrate the process of building categories thematically: in attempting to engage users in planning issues via social media, Evans-Cowley and Hollander [11] found combinations of in-person and online participation to be more effective than online communication alone.""

The paper does not appear to contain a PRISMA diagram or any other flow diagram illustrating the literature search and screening process. The paper does describe the systematic review methodology used, including the databases searched and the inclusion/exclusion criteria, but it does not provide a visual representation of this process.

  - ""Initially, 608 articles were identified from the literature searches after duplicate entries had been removed. Thirteen additional articles were selected from examination of reference lists and citing literature. After screening the titles and abstracts, the full texts of 130 articles were examined in detail.
