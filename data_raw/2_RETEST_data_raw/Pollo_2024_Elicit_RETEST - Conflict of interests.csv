The paper does not mention any conflict of interests. There are no statements from the authors regarding any potential conflicts of interest. The paper focuses on presenting the results of a meta-analysis on the effect of male mating history on female reproductive output in Lepidoptera species.

""We therefore performed a metaanalysis to explore the effect of male mating history on female reproductive output to ascertain whether a general trend across Lepidoptera species can be detected.""

The paper does not mention any conflicts of interest. There are no statements from the authors regarding any potential conflicts of interest. The paper focuses on presenting the results of a meta-analysis on assortative mating in animals, and does not discuss any potential conflicts that the authors may have.

Darwinian sex roles confirmed across the animal kingdom,"Tim Janicke, Ines K Häderer, Marc J Lajeunesse, Nils Anthes",-,-,Science Advances,323,2016,Janicke_2016.pdf,not declared specifically,,,"
The paper does not mention any conflicts of interest. There are no statements from the authors regarding any potential conflicts of interest. The paper does not contain a ""Conflict of interests"" section or any other indication that the authors disclosed any conflicts of interest.

The paper does not contain any information about conflicts of interest.

Measuring and interpreting sexual selection metrics: evaluation and guidelines,"Nils Anthes, Ines K H € Aderer, Nico K Michiels, Tim Janicke",-,-,,41,2017,Anthes_2017.pdf,not declared specifically,"  - ""Data underlying the analyses in this manuscript are deposited in the Dryad repository for Figures 2 and 4 (http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad. rs69k) (Anthes et al. 2016) and all other Figures (http://datadryad.org/resource/ doi:10.5061/dryad.780d6) (Janicke et al. 2016).""",,"
The paper does not explicitly declare any conflict of interest. There is no section or statement in the paper that discusses potential conflicts of interest. The closest relevant information is the following quote:

""Data underlying the analyses in this manuscript are deposited in the Dryad repository for Figures 2 and 4 (http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad. rs69k) (Anthes et al. 2016) and all other Figures (http://datadryad.org/resource/ doi:10.5061/dryad.780d6) (Janicke et al. 2016).""

This indicates that the data used in the analysis was previously published, but does not provide any information about potential conflicts of interest.

Mechanisms of Social Influence: A Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Social Information on Female Mate Choice Decisions,"Blake Carlton Jones, Emily H Duval",-,-,Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution,33,2019,Jones_2019.pdf,yes,"  - ""The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.""",,"
The paper states that the authors declare ""The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."" This indicates that the authors explicitly declared that there were no conflicts of interest.

To determine if the conflict of interests was disclosed, I will look for any statements from the authors regarding potential conflicts of interest.
""We declare we have no competing interests.""
The authors explicitly state that they have no competing interests, indicating that any potential conflicts of interest have been disclosed.

The relative importance of size and asymmetry in sexual selection,"R Thornhid', A P M0ller, A P Moller",-,-,,87,1998,Thornhill_1998.pdf,not declared specifically,"  - ""The aim of the present study was to test whether the magnitude of the effect of asymmetry on sexual selection was similar to that of character size per se, which is known from numerous studies to be related to sexual selection (see review in Andersson, 1994).""
  - ""Meta-analysis consists of obtaining an estimate of the magnitude of a general effect of interest from each of a number of studies, calculating average effects, and elucidating moderator variables that account for heterogeneity among studies.""
