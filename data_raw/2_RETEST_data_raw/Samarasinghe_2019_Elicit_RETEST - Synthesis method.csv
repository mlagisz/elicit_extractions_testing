Built environmental correlates of older adults' total physical activity and walking: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"David W Barnett, Anthony Barnett, Andrea Nathan, Jelle Van Cauwenberg, Ester Cerin",-,-,-,-,-,Barnett_2017.pdf,quantitative,"  - ""Due to the large range of different environmental and PA measures reported in the selected articles, it was not possible to conduct a 'traditional' meta-analysis involving the estimation of pooled effect sizes and their 95% confidence intervals. Hence, to quantitatively synthesise the findings, a meta-analytic approach was applied to define conservative estimates of p-values for each examined combination of environmental attribute and PA outcome [27].""
  - ""All of these findings were then included into a ""Total PA"" outcome, which was then stratified by PA measurement type (objective or self-report). ""Total walking"" was considered separately and was based on findings from self-report walking only, as the majority of associations between built environmental attributes and objectively assessed walking was insufficiently examined (i.e., <5 findings) (Additional file 3).""

Economic analysis of the health impacts of housing improvement studies: a systematic review,"Elisabeth Fenwick, Catriona Macdonald, Hilary Thomson",-,-,Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health,35,2013,Fenwick_2013.pdf,qualitative,"  - ""Forty-five studies were identified in the original review. The study designs varied and included five randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and 23 non-randomised controlled studies. The better quality RCTs and controlled studies were used to draw conclusions about effectiveness.""
  - ""Findings from the studies which report costs only, suggest that fuel costs may reduce following provision of warmth and energy efficiency improvements, and that rents may increase following housing improvement. These findings need careful interpretation.""",,"
The paper does not describe a formal synthesis method for combining the evidence from the included studies. Instead, it appears to take a narrative approach to summarizing the cost and economic analysis data reported in the studies.

""Forty-five studies were identified in the original review. The study designs varied and included five randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and 23 non-randomised controlled studies. The better quality RCTs and controlled studies were used to draw conclusions about effectiveness.""
This quote indicates that the original review used the higher quality studies to draw conclusions about the health impacts of housing interventions, but does not describe how the economic data was synthesized.

""Studies which present cost data without economic evaluation were further examined for the potential to have conducted an economic evaluation, that is, presence of a suitable health outcome which could be linked to cost and compared to an alternative (table 1 ). Studies which reported having undertaken an economic evaluation (table 3 ) were examined to determine the precise form of that analysis (table 1 ).""
This quote describes how the authors categorized the included studies based on whether they reported cost data or claimed to have conducted an economic evaluation, and then examined the details of those analyses. However, it does not indicate that any statistical synthesis was performed.

""Findings from the studies which report costs only, suggest that fuel costs may reduce following provision of warmth and energy efficiency improvements, and that rents may increase following housing improvement. These findings need careful interpretation.""
This quote summarizes the narrative findings from the studies reporting cost data, but again does not describe any quantitative synthesis.

Impacts of heat waves and corresponding measures: a review,"Jian Zuo, Stephen Pullen, Jasmine Palmer, Helen Bennetts, Nicholas Chileshe, Tony Ma",-,-,,231,2015,Zuo_2015.pdf,qualitative,"  - ""The knowledge gap is identified as a result of which a future research agenda has been suggested.""
  - ""A list of keywords was used to search related papers and reports. These keywords include: extreme weather conditions; heat waves; hot spell; health; overheating; mechanisms; building, etc. As a result, 173 papers and reports were selected to be critically reviewed in this study.""
  - ""This paper reports on a critical literature review which covers the following main aspects: (1) the definition of heat waves; (2) the impacts of heat waves on health, ecosystems and the built environment;

(3) the current mechanisms to deal with impacts of heat waves.""",,"
The paper does not explicitly state the ""Synthesis method"" used. However, based on the information provided in the paper, it appears to be a qualitative review:
""This paper reports on a critical literature review which covers the following main aspects: (1) the definition of heat waves; (2) the impacts of heat waves on health, ecosystems and the built environment; (3) the current mechanisms to deal with impacts of heat waves.""
The paper does not mention any statistical synthesis of results from primary studies, such as meta-analysis or meta-regression. Instead, it provides a narrative summary of the existing literature on heat waves and their impacts:
""A list of keywords was used to search related papers and reports. These keywords include: extreme weather conditions; heat waves; hot spell; health; overheating; mechanisms; building, etc. As a result, 173 papers and reports were selected to be critically reviewed in this study.""
""The knowledge gap is identified as a result of which a future research agenda has been suggested.""
The paper also includes some quantitative information, such as numbers and statistics from primary studies, but these are used to support the narrative synthesis rather than as a standalone quantitative analysis.

Latent heat storage in building elements: A systematic review on properties and contextual performance factors,"A Mavrigiannaki, E Ampatzi",-,-,,78,2016,Mavrigiannaki_2016.pdf,qualitative,"  - ""the added value in systematic reviews is the transparency of the methodology used which allows reproducibility and thus creates a precedent for future reviews to build upon.""
  - ""A systematic review uses clearly defined search criteria that are justified by the scope and orientation of the research [21,26]. The present review is concerned with LHS, having a focus on PCM integration in building elements.""
  - ""Following guidance for systematic reviews [21,26], a data extraction method was developed. In [27] evaluation criteria for thermal energy storage implementation have been proposed.

  - ""The search process tracked 140 studies to be reviewed. These covered a variety of building elements; more popular being walls (Fig. 2 ). Following the review, 20 papers were identified as inappropriate for data extraction and were excluded from the analysis.""",,"
The paper describes using a systematic review methodology, which involves a structured and transparent process for identifying, selecting, and synthesizing relevant literature. The authors state that they ""employed a systematic (structured) review procedure"" and that ""the added value in systematic reviews is the transparency of the methodology used which allows reproducibility and thus creates a precedent for future reviews to build upon.""

The paper does not mention conducting any quantitative statistical synthesis of the results from the primary studies, such as a meta-analysis. Rather, the authors state that they ""critically evaluated"" the literature and ""used a data extraction procedure to organise, analyse and report design and performance parameters of Phase Change Material (PCM) elements."" This suggests a qualitative synthesis approach.

  - ""Further classification of the evidence was based upon criteria provided in the review of Wendel-Vos and colleagues [14]. In specific, the number of times an environmental factor was significantly related to a PA domain was divided by the total amount of records on this relationship.

The paper describes the synthesis method used in this systematic review as a quantitative approach. The authors state that they calculated ""summary scores"" to express the strength of the relationship between each environmental factor and different PA domains:

""Further classification of the evidence was based upon criteria provided in the review of Wendel-Vos and colleagues [14].

The authors also mention that they used a qualitative approach to summarize the evidence:

""Summary codes for possible evidence were also applied if an association was found in 40-50% of all records. Associations found in less than 40% of all records, or in 40-50% of all records in one direction with at least 25% in the opposite, was regarded as no evidence, summary coded ""0"".""

Therefore, the synthesis method used in this review was a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches, as the authors used both statistical analysis to calculate summary scores as well as qualitative criteria to classify the strength of the evidence.

""A meta-analysis of the results was not conducted. The locations, time periods studied and climate model data used to estimate future heat-related mortality varied considerably between the selected articles. Instead, a descriptive summary of the estimates is provided.""
The paper also mentions that the authors did not publish a protocol for this systematic review:
""A protocol for this systematic review has not been published.""
Based on the information provided, the synthesis method used in this review appears to be qualitative, as the authors did not conduct any statistical synthesis of the results from the individual studies. They instead provided a narrative summary of the estimates.
