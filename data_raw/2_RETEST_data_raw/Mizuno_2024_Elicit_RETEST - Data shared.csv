Body size affects the evolution of eyespots in caterpillars,"Thomas John Hossie, John Skelhorn, Jesse W Breinholt, Akito Y Kawahara, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,49,2015,Hossie_2015.pdf,yes,"  - ""We conducted a PGLS analysis on the ML tree with body size as the response variable and the presence/absence of eyespots as a binary predictor (factors are not permitted as response variables in PGLS). We ran PGLS models assuming either a Brownian motion or an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (54) model of evolution, and then compared their fits using a likelihood ratio test (55). To test whether accounting for phylogenetic autocorrelation was necessary, we tested whether the residuals from a linear model without phylogenetic control showed a phylogenetic signal (56) using the ""phylosig"" function in the R package ""phytools"" (57). We estimated the strength of the association by comparing the residual variance of the model and the null model (assuming the same correlation structure; i.e., 1

), as outlined by Paradis (58).""
  - ""The design of artificial prey for the laboratory presentations to domestic chicks was slightly modified to allow the inclusion of two additional treatments to account for a possible confounding effect of eyespot size. Specifically, small prey were 25 mm long and 6 mm in diameter, and large prey were 40 mm long and 7 mm in diameter. For each prey body size, either small or large eyespots (2.2 mm or 4.5 mm diameter, respectively) were added such that six treatments were produced: small-no eyespots, small-small eyespots, small-large eyespots, large-no eyespots, large-small eyespots, and largelarge eyespots.""
  - ""Artificial caterpillars were designed to quantify the selective advantage of eyespots on large and small prey. Construction of artificial caterpillars followed a methodology similar to that used in previous studies (11,12). The caterpillar models in our field experiment comprised four treatments: small-no eyespots, large-no eyespots, small-eyespots, and largeeyespots. All treatments were similarly countershaded, because Hossie and Sherratt (12) revealed that eyespots effectively protected these artificial caterpillars from birds only when the caterpillars were countershaded as well.""",,"
The paper states that the data matrix used for the phylogenetic analysis has been provided as a supplementary file:

The paper also states that the data matrix has a significantly expanded taxon set from a previously published study:

""We used R 2.9.2 for Windows (R Development Core Team 2009) for analyzing the data.""
This quote indicates that the authors analyzed the data, but does not specify whether the raw data has been shared.
""The experimental protocol and housing of birds was reviewed and approved by the regional ethical committee in Linköping (Dnr: 62-08).""
This quote discusses the experimental protocol, but again does not mention data sharing.
""All the birds maintained their condition and were healthy upon release.""
This quote is about the condition of the birds, and does not relate to data sharing.

Based on the lack of any explicit statements about data sharing in the paper, the most likely answer is that the raw data has not been shared publicly.
