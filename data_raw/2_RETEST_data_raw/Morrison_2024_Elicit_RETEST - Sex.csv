Behavioral effects of triadimefon in zebrafish are associated with alterations of the dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways,"Susana Paredes-Zúñiga, Nils Trost, Javiera F De La Paz, Julio Alcayaga, Miguel L Allende",-,-,Progress in Neuro-psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry,26,2019,zuniga_2019.pdf,both/mixed,"  - ""Experimentally naïve zebrafish of both sexes (50% each) and similar size were used. Since gender could affect the behavioral outcome, we previously analyzed our data observing no statistical differences between males and females (data not shown).""",,"
The paper does not explicitly state the sex of the zebrafish used in the pesticide exposure experiments. However, it does mention the following:
""Experimentally naïve zebrafish of both sexes (50% each) and similar size were used. Since gender could affect the behavioral outcome, we previously analyzed our data observing no statistical differences between males and females (data not shown).""
This quote indicates that the researchers used both male and female zebrafish in equal proportions (50% each) for the adult zebrafish behavioral experiments. The paper also states that the researchers did not find any statistical differences in the behavioral outcomes between males and females.

Neurobehavioral Impairments Caused by Developmental Imidacloprid Exposure in Zebrafish,"Emily B Crosby, Jordan M Bailey, Anthony N Oliveri, Edward D Levin",-,-,Neurotoxicology and Teratology,145,2015,crosby_2015.pdf,both/mixed,"  - ""The procedures were approved by the Duke University Institutional Review Committee for the use of animal subjects.

  - ""Several adolescent or adult zebrafish across all exposure groups exhibited a mild mini-fin mutant phenotype (Connors et al., 1999), which was only apparent as the fish increased in size).

  - ""All zebrafish, in each testing age group (i.e. larval, adolescent and adult), were treated with imidacloprid, nicotine or vehicle control for 0-5 dpf (with daily renewal of solutions).""",,"
The paper does not explicitly state the sex of the zebrafish used in the pesticide exposure experiment. However, it provides some relevant information that can be used to infer the sex:
""All zebrafish, in each testing age group (i.e. larval, adolescent and adult), were treated with imidacloprid, nicotine or vehicle control for 0-5 dpf (with daily renewal of solutions).""
This quote indicates that the zebrafish were not differentiated by sex for the exposure experiment, as the same treatments were applied to all zebrafish regardless of age group.
""Several adolescent or adult zebrafish across all exposure groups exhibited a mild mini-fin mutant phenotype (Connors et al., 1999), which was only apparent as the fish increased in size). This is a genetic malformation of the tail that can alter swimming; consequently, all mini-fin subjects were excluded from behavioral testing.""
This quote suggests that the zebrafish used were a mix of males and females, as the mini-fin mutation can occur in both sexes.
""The procedures were approved by the Duke University Institutional Review Committee for the use of animal subjects. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) from two wild-type strains, AB* and 5D, were maintained in a colony room at approximately 28.5°C on a 14:10-h light/dark cycle.""
This quote indicates that the zebrafish used were wild-type, which means they were not genetically modified and likely represented a mix of males and females.

The paper does not explicitly state the sex of the zebrafish used in the experiment. However, it does mention that ""Adult zebrafish (Danio rerio as GloFish™) of mixed gender were purchased from a local commercial supplier and maintained in the Open-RAC recirculating zebrafish maintenance system."" This quote indicates that the zebrafish used were of mixed gender, meaning both male and female.

The paper does not explicitly state the sex of the authors, Jonna Boyda, Andrew B Hawkey, Zade R Holloway, Rafael Trevisan, Richard T Di Giulio, Edward D Levin, and G A Richardson. However, the paper does provide information about the sex of the zebrafish used in the pesticide exposure experiment.

""Cohorts of tested fish contained equal numbers of male and female zebrafish, as available within offspring bred for this study.""
This quote indicates that the zebrafish used in the experiment were both male and female.

""Sample sizes of analyzed data were between 21 and 30 for each group for any given test, based on survival to late adulthood and adequate motion tracking of collected videos (subject identified in >96% of images within video).""
This quote suggests that the sample sizes included both male and female zebrafish, as the authors needed to have enough fish of each sex to analyze the data.

""Sex differences were found in the livers of males and females (Supplemental Fig. 7 ). Males have significantly increased total basal respiration compared to females in the control, 70 nM, and 210 nM groups (p < 0.05; p < 0.001; p < 0.05) (Supplemental Fig. 7A ). There were also trends that mitochondrial basal respiration was increased in males compared to females (Supplemental Fig. 7B ).""
This quote directly states that the authors found sex differences in the liver tissue of the zebrafish, indicating that both male and female zebrafish were used in the experiment.

The paper explicitly states that the zebrafish used in the experiment were adult male zebrafish:

""The fish were then separated into 3 groups (Control, 0.05% DMSO; TBT-low, 100 ng/L and TBT-high, 500 ng/L) with triplicate tanks (50 cm × 25 cm × 30 cm, containing 6 individuals in 20 L exposure water per tank) per group.""
""After exposure, the novel tank dive test was conducted following the method provided by Egan et al. (2009). Briefly, the test tank (15 cm × 20 cm × 25 cm) with 10 cm water was divided equally into two parts (lower and upper) by drawing a horizontal line (5 cm from the bottom) through the center of the water column prior to the test. Three fish from each tank (9 fish for each group; N = 9) was then placed into the test tank individually.""
The paper clearly states that the zebrafish used in the experiment were adult male zebrafish.

The paper does not explicitly state the sex of the zebrafish used in the pesticide exposure experiment. However, it does provide some relevant information:
""Adult zebrafish (D. rerio) were kept at approximately 28.5 °C on a 12:12-hour light\dark cycle.""
This indicates that adult zebrafish were used in the study, but does not specify the sex.
""Zebrafish embryos were collected at the beginning of the 14-h light cycle on the morning following pairing of AB* strain adult breeders.""
This suggests that both male and female adult zebrafish were used to produce the embryos for the experiment, but again does not directly state the sex of the zebrafish used in the behavioral testing.
