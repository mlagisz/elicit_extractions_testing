The paper does not mention or provide a PRISMA diagram. The paper states that the authors ""consulted scientific literature databases, the Internet and previous reviews on this and related topics (Ridley 1988;Vahed 1998;Arnqvist and Nilsson 2000;Torres-Vila et al. 2004) to compile data from 29 studies of 25 Lepidopteran species that related female reproductive output to male mating history (Table 1)."" This indicates that the authors conducted a literature search and review to gather the data for their meta-analysis, but they did not provide a PRISMA-like flowchart to document their search and screening process.

Assortative Mating in Animals,"Yuexin Jiang, Daniel I Bolnick, Mark Kirkpatrick",-,-,American Naturalist,363,2013,Jiang_2013.pdf,not applicable,"  - ""We reviewed more than 13,000 publications. While the search was thorough, it is certain that there are publications that our search did not find. However, an exhaustive search is not necessary for meta-analysis, which is fundamentally a sampling activity intended to retrieve studies that are representative of the question of interest.""
  - ""We searched for publications reporting suitable measures of assortative mating, using keywords searches in multiple databases, including Google Scholar, JSTOR, and Web of Science. We also examined the reference sections of relevant publications to find additional studies.""
  - ""We excluded studies of assortative mating between incipient species, populations undergoing secondary contact or other forms of hybridization, host races, as well as populations whose conspecific status is ambiguous.""",,"
The paper does not mention a ""PRISMA diagram"" or any other flowchart depicting the literature search and screening process. Instead, the authors describe their search and screening methods in the following quotes:
""We searched for publications reporting suitable measures of assortative mating, using keywords searches in multiple databases, including Google Scholar, JSTOR, and Web of Science. We also examined the reference sections of relevant publications to find additional studies.""

The paper mentions that the ""systematic literature search largely followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement"". This indicates that the authors did conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature, and that they likely provided a PRISMA-like flowchart to document the search and screening process.

""The systematic literature search largely followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement (44).""
""We first identified relevant studies from ISI Web of Knowledge (Web of Science Core Collection, from 1900 to 2014) with the ""topic"" search terms defined as (""Bateman*"" OR ""opportunit* for selection"" OR ""opportunit* for sexual selection"" OR ""selection gradient*"").

Measuring and interpreting sexual selection metrics: evaluation and guidelines,"Nils Anthes, Ines K H € Aderer, Nico K Michiels, Tim Janicke",-,-,,41,2017,Anthes_2017.pdf,insufficient,"  - ""Throughout, we exemplify those issues with a focus on the Bateman gradient (b ss ), representing a widely used integrative proxy of sexual selection (Klug et al. 2010)""
  - ""Drawing from a recent meta-analysis, we evaluate potential biases arising from study design, data collection and parameter estimation, and provide suggestions to mitigate such biases in future studies.""
  - ""We scrutinize the quantification of (sex differences in) sexual selection metrics with respect to three components: the underlying study design (section 'Study design'), data collection (section 'Data collection'), and parameter estimation (section 'Parameter estimation').""",,"
The paper does not mention or provide a PRISMA diagram. There is no indication that the authors conducted a systematic literature search and screening process to identify the studies included in their analysis. The paper states that the data used in the analyses comes from a ""meta-analysis database"" (Janicke et al. 2016), but does not describe how that database was compiled.

Mechanisms of Social Influence: A Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Social Information on Female Mate Choice Decisions,"Blake Carlton Jones, Emily H Duval",-,-,Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution,33,2019,Jones_2019.pdf,adequate,"  - ""We further excluded 14 studies that did not experimentally assess mate-choice copying directly or at all. We were left with 40 empirical studies reporting 103 separate experiments that tested directly for female mate-choice copying (Figure 1).""",,"
The paper states that a PRISMA-like flowchart was provided:
""We further excluded 14 studies that did not experimentally assess mate-choice copying directly or at all. We were left with 40 empirical studies reporting 103 separate experiments that tested directly for female mate-choice copying (Figure 1).""
The paper mentions that Figure 1 shows the flow of studies through the screening and selection process, which is a key component of a PRISMA diagram. The paper also provides details on the specific criteria used to include and exclude studies, which is another important aspect of a PRISMA diagram.

No evidence of immediate fitness benefits of within-season divorce in monogamous birds,"Antica Culina, Lyanne Brouwer",-,-,Biology Letters,5,2022,Culina_2022.pdf,adequate,"  - ""Following the steps of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA, [24]) 33 eligible studies were detected (see data tables, also electronic supplementary material, Methods for PRISMA diagrams).""",,"
The paper states that the authors followed the steps of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines:
""Following the steps of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA, [24]) 33 eligible studies were detected (see data tables, also electronic supplementary material, Methods for PRISMA diagrams).""
This indicates that the authors provided a PRISMA diagram or flowchart to document their literature search and screening process. The paper also states that the details on the complete search syntaxes and PRISMA diagrams can be found in the electronic supplementary materials.

The relative importance of size and asymmetry in sexual selection,"R Thornhid', A P M0ller, A P Moller",-,-,,87,1998,Thornhill_1998.pdf,not applicable,"  - ""The data set used for the present study is from Mailer and Thornhill (1998), which was based on (1) a comprehensive search of the literature and of the Internet for information on the relationship between asymmetry and sexual selection, and (2) correspondence between the authors and behavioral ecologists conducting research on this relationship.""
  - ""Because we investigated the relative effect size for symmetry versus character size for the same trait, the only studies included from Mailer and Thornhill (1998) were those that had one or more estimates that allowed calculation of an effect size for the relationship between asymmetry and character size, and mating success or a mate preference, respectively.""",,"
The paper does not mention or provide a PRISMA diagram. There is no indication that the authors conducted a systematic literature search and screening process to identify the studies included in the meta-analysis. Instead, the paper states that the data set used was from a previous meta-analysis by the same authors:

""The data set used for the present study is from Mailer and Thornhill (1998), which was based on (1) a comprehensive search of the literature and of the Internet for information on the relationship between asymmetry and sexual selection, and (2) correspondence between the authors and behavioral ecologists conducting research on this relationship.""

The paper also mentions that they only included studies from the previous meta-analysis that had information on both size and asymmetry:

""Because we investigated the relative effect size for symmetry versus character size for the same trait, the only studies included from Mailer and Thornhill (1998) were those that had one or more estimates that allowed calculation of an effect size for the relationship between asymmetry and character size, and mating success or a mate preference, respectively.""

Since the current paper does not describe a systematic literature search and screening process, but rather uses data from a previous meta-analysis, a PRISMA diagram is not applicable.

Variation in pre-and post-copulatory sexual selection on male genital size in two species of lygaeid bug,"Liam R Dougherty, David M Shuker",-,-,Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology,18,2016,Dougherty_2016.pdf,insufficient,"  - ""We expand on the earlier study by Tadler (1999) by also recording male mating success.""
  - ""Finally, we assessed how the strength of selection varied across studies in L. simulans by using formal metaanalysis to combine selection gradients reported in previous studies with those found here.""
  - ""To visualise the shape of selection on processus length, we produced fitness surfaces using cubic splines, which are nonparametric curves that can be used to visualise complex shapes (Schluter 1988).""",,"
The paper does not mention or provide a PRISMA diagram. There is no indication that the authors conducted a systematic literature search and screening process to identify relevant studies for their meta-analysis. The paper focuses on reporting the results of two experiments conducted by the authors on Lygaeus equestris and Lygaeus simulans, as well as a meta-analysis of previous studies on Lygaeus simulans.

The relevant quotes that support this are:
""We expand on the earlier study by Tadler (1999) by also recording male mating success.""
This indicates the authors used data from a previous study by Tadler (1999) in their meta-analysis.
""To visualise the shape of selection on processus length, we produced fitness surfaces using cubic splines, which are nonparametric curves that can be used to visualise complex shapes (Schluter 1988).""
This quote suggests the authors used their own experimental data to produce the fitness surfaces, rather than conducting a systematic literature search.
""Finally, we assessed how the strength of selection varied across studies in L. simulans by using formal metaanalysis to combine selection gradients reported in previous studies with those found here.""
This quote directly states that the authors used previous studies in their meta-analysis, but does not indicate they conducted a systematic literature search.
