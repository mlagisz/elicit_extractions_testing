Can the way pigs are handled alter behavioural and physiological measures of affective state?,"Ricard Carreras, Laura Arroyo, Eva Mainau, Daniel Valent, Anna Bassols, Antoni Dalmau, Luigi Faucitano, Xavier Manteca, Antonio Velarde",-,-,Behavioural Processes,16,2017,Carreras2017.pdf,female,"  - ""In this study, 56 female pigs ((Landrace x Large White) x Piétrain) were used.""
  - ""At the end of the reminder sessions, each pig was individually subjected to the CBT where a bucket containing two pieces of chopped apple that were accessible by the pig was placed in the middle of the pen.""
  - ""Pigs were individually trained and assessed in the CBT according to the methodology described by Carreras et al. (2016). In brief, pigs were trained to discriminate between a bucket with or without access (A and NA, respectively) to chopped apples and positioned in the left or right side of the test pen.""",,"
The paper explicitly states that the study used female pigs:
""In this study, 56 female pigs ((Landrace x Large White) x Piétrain) were used.""
There is no mention of any male pigs being used in the study. The paper consistently refers to the pigs using female pronouns (e.g. ""she"", ""her"") throughout.

"Does stocking density modify affective state in pigs as assessed by cognitive bias, behavioural and physiological parameters?","Annalisa Scollo, Flaviana Gottardo, Barbara Contiero, Sandra A Edwards",-,-,,62,2014,Scollo2014.pdf,both,"  - ""A total of 40 entire male and female crossbred pigs (Large White × Landrace), which had previously experienced the same housing and management conditions, were selected at approximately 14 weeks of age and 45 kg live weight.

The paper explicitly states that the study used both female and male pigs:

Effect of gender and halothane genotype on cognitive bias and its relationship with fear in pigs,"Ricard Carreras, Laura Arroyo, Eva Mainau, Raquel Pe Ña, Anna Bassols, Antoni Dalmau, Luigi Faucitano, Xavier Manteca, Antonio Velarde",-,-,,17,2016,Carreras2016.pdf,both,"  - ""The proportion of CB classes was not affected by gender (p = 0.278), genotype (p = 0.358) and their interaction (p = 0.560).""
  - ""No differences between genders (p = 0.384) and Hal genotypes (p = 0.950), and no effect of their interaction (p = 0.456) were found regarding the latency to contact the bucket during the training and reminder sessions.""
  - ""A total of 48 pigs, in terms of 12Hal-free gilts (NNG), 12Hal carrier gilts (NnG), and 12Hal-free entire males (NNEM) and 12Hal carrier entire males (NnEM) were put on the CBT at the age of 20 weeks and on the NOT four days later.""",,"
The paper states that the study used both female and male pigs, referred to as ""gilts"" and ""entire males"" respectively:
""A total of 48 pigs, in terms of 12Hal-free gilts (NNG), 12Hal carrier gilts (NnG), and 12Hal-free entire males (NNEM) and 12Hal carrier entire males (NnEM) were put on the CBT at the age of 20 weeks and on the NOT four days later.""
""No differences between genders (p = 0.384) and Hal genotypes (p = 0.950), and no effect of their interaction (p = 0.456) were found regarding the latency to contact the bucket during the training and reminder sessions.""
""The proportion of CB classes was not affected by gender (p = 0.278), genotype (p = 0.358) and their interaction (p = 0.560).""
The paper clearly states that both female (gilts) and male (entire males) pigs were used in the study, and the results did not show any significant effects of gender on the cognitive bias test or novel object test.

"Effects of Cage Enrichment on Behavior, Welfare and Outcome Variability in Female Mice","Jeremy D Bailoo, Eimear Murphy, Maria Boada-Saña, Justin A Varholick, Sara Hintze, Caroline Baussière, Kerstin C Hahn, Christine Göpfert, Rupert Palme, Bernhard Voelkl, Hanno Würbel",-,-,Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience,85,2018,Bailoo_2018.pdf,female,"  - ""Subjects were 192 female mice, 96 each of the inbred strain C57BL/6JRj (C57) and the outbred strain RjOrl:SWISS (SWISS) from Janvier Labs, France.""

Frontal brain deactivation during a non-verbal cognitive judgement bias test in sheep,"Kathrin Guldimann, Sabine Vögeli, Martin Wolf, Beat Wechsler, Lorenz Gygax",-,-,Brain and Cognition,20,2015,Guldimann2015.pdf,female,"  - ""Twenty-nine female non-lactating and non-gestating Lacaune sheep about 2.5 years of age made up the two groups used in this experiment (Vögeli et al., 2014).""
  - ""24 focal sheep (12 from each housing group) that had previously been chosen at random were included in the cognitive judgement bias test. With one exception, these focal sheep had been involved in a series of experiments in which they were exposed to different sets of stimuli thought to induce emotional reactions (Vögeli, Wolf, Wechsler, & Gygax, unpublished results; Vögeli et al., 2014) and in a previous cognitive judgement bias test (Vögeli et al., 2014).""",,"
The paper explicitly states that the 29 sheep used in the experiment were all female:
""Twenty-nine female non-lactating and non-gestating Lacaune sheep about 2.5 years of age made up the two groups used in this experiment (Vögeli et al., 2014).""
The paper also mentions that the 24 focal sheep included in the cognitive judgement bias test were a subset of the 29 sheep, with one exception:
""24 focal sheep (12 from each housing group) that had previously been chosen at random were included in the cognitive judgement bias test. With one exception, these focal sheep had been involved in a series of experiments in which they were exposed to different sets of stimuli thought to induce emotional reactions (Vögeli, Wolf, Wechsler, & Gygax, unpublished results; Vögeli et al., 2014) and in a previous cognitive judgement bias test (Vögeli et al., 2014).""
Since the paper explicitly states that only female sheep were used, and does not mention any male sheep, the answer is that the sex of the tested animals in the compared groups was female.

""Female Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) were hatched and reared at the Institute of Animal Biochemistry and Genetics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Ivanka pri Dunaji, Slovak Republic.""
The paper does not mention using any male quail in the experiments. All references to the test subjects use the term ""quail hens"" or ""female quail"", indicating that only female quail were used.

  - ""We assigned the bears to two age-and sexmatched experimental groups (3 and 6 reward groups, respectively), each comprising two adult females with extensive positive reinforcement training experience (e.g., voluntary blood draws, collaring, and echocardiograms, using honey water as the reinforcement), one adult male with little training experience, and one adult female with no prior training experience.""

The paper states that the study used 8 adult grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) from the Washington State University Bear Research, Education, and Conservation Center. It then provides more details on the bears:

Based on these quotes, the study used both female and male grizzly bears, so the answer is ""both"".
