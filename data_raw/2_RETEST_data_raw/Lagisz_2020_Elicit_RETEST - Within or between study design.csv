Can the way pigs are handled alter behavioural and physiological measures of affective state?,"Ricard Carreras, Laura Arroyo, Eva Mainau, Daniel Valent, Anna Bassols, Antoni Dalmau, Luigi Faucitano, Xavier Manteca, Antonio Velarde",-,-,Behavioural Processes,16,2017,Carreras2017.pdf,between,"  - ""The pigs in one of the rooms received positive handling (pH) and the pigs in the other room received negative handling (NH).""",,"
The study design appears to be a between-individual study design, where two groups of pigs were subjected to different handling treatments (positive handling vs. negative handling):
""At 19 weeks of age, pigs in one of the rooms received positive handling (pH) and the pigs in the other room received negative handling (NH).""
""The pH treatment consisted in entering the room slowly and letting the pigs looking at the experimenter with binocular vision before entering the pens. [...] The NH treatment consisted in entering the room quickly and talking loudly.""
""The pigs in one of the rooms received positive handling (pH) and the pigs in the other room received negative handling (NH).""
The paper clearly states that the pigs were divided into two separate rooms, with one group receiving positive handling and the other receiving negative handling. This indicates a between-individual study design, where the two groups were subjected to different treatments simultaneously.

"Does stocking density modify affective state in pigs as assessed by cognitive bias, behavioural and physiological parameters?","Annalisa Scollo, Flaviana Gottardo, Barbara Contiero, Sandra A Edwards",-,-,,62,2014,Scollo2014.pdf,between,"  - ""All experimental procedures and animal care were carried out in accordance with the minimum standards for the protection of pigs laid down by law (Council of The European Union, 2008), and were approved by the Ethical Review Committee of Newcastle University.""
  - ""For the low space allowance treatment k = 0.030, approximating the current European Union minimum standard required (Council of The European Union, 2008). For the high space allowance treatment k = 0.048, according to the recommendation of the Scientific Panel on Animal Health and Welfare of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA AHAW panel, 2005) for permitting the animals to lie in full recumbency.""
  - ""Two pens of pigs were housed at each of two different stocking densities.""",,"
The study design appears to be a between-individual study design, where two groups of pigs were housed at different stocking densities and then compared on various measures:
""Two pens of pigs were housed at each of two different stocking densities.""
""For the low space allowance treatment k = 0.030, approximating the current European Union minimum standard required (Council of The European Union, 2008). For the high space allowance treatment k = 0.048, according to the recommendation of the Scientific Panel on Animal Health and Welfare of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA AHAW panel, 2005) for permitting the animals to lie in full recumbency.""
""All experimental procedures and animal care were carried out in accordance with the minimum standards for the protection of pigs laid down by law (Council of The European Union, 2008), and were approved by the Ethical Review Committee of Newcastle University.""
The paper does not mention any within-individual design, where the same pigs would be exposed to both low and high stocking densities. Instead, it clearly states that two separate groups of pigs were housed at the different densities.

Effect of gender and halothane genotype on cognitive bias and its relationship with fear in pigs,"Ricard Carreras, Laura Arroyo, Eva Mainau, Raquel Pe Ña, Anna Bassols, Antoni Dalmau, Luigi Faucitano, Xavier Manteca, Antonio Velarde",-,-,,17,2016,Carreras2016.pdf,between,"  - ""In this study, 48 crossbred pigs (Landrace × Large White sows sired with Piétrain boars) were divided into four groups of 12 pigs each. Each group either consisted of Hal-free gilts, Hal-free entire males (NNG and NNEM), Hal carrier gilts and Hal carrier entire males (NnG and NnEM).""",,"
The study design appears to be a between-individual design, as the paper states that the 48 pigs were divided into four groups of 12 pigs each based on gender (gilts vs. entire males) and halothane genotype (Hal-free vs. Hal carrier):
""In this study, 48 crossbred pigs (Landrace × Large White sows sired with Piétrain boars) were divided into four groups of 12 pigs each. Each group either consisted of Hal-free gilts, Hal-free entire males (NNG and NNEM), Hal carrier gilts and Hal carrier entire males (NnG and NnEM).""
The paper does not mention any within-individual design where the same pigs were subjected to different treatments sequentially. Rather, the different groups were compared to assess the effects of gender and genotype on cognitive bias and fear response.

To determine the study design, I will look for information in the paper that describes how the different housing conditions were assigned to the mice.

""We used a 4 (cage enrichment) × 2 (mouse strain) factorial design conducted in two consecutive batches of equal size; the second batch began 3 weeks after the end of the first batch.""
This quote indicates that the study used a between-subjects design, with mice randomly assigned to one of four housing conditions (B, N, E, SE) and two mouse strains (C57BL/6 and SWISS).

""Mice were randomly allocated to the four housing conditions, B, N, E and SE, described in further detail in Supplementary Table S1 . They were housed in groups of three per cage, with four replicate cages per strain and treatment in each batch (see Supplementary Table S2 ).""
This quote further confirms that the mice were randomly assigned to the different housing conditions, indicating a between-subjects design.

""For assessing recurrent perseveration and judgment bias, one focal animal from three of the four cages per treatment, strain and batch were randomly selected (n = 48 in total).""
This quote indicates that a subset of the mice from each housing condition were selected for additional testing, but the overall study design was still between-subjects.

  - ""To induce a relatively more negative or more positive mood, the sheep had been subjected to either unpredictable, stimulus-poor or predictable, stimulus-rich housing conditions, respectively, since July 2011 (Vögeli et al., 2014).""",,"
The study design appears to be a between-individual design, where two groups of sheep were subjected to different housing conditions (unpredictable, stimulus-poor vs. predictable, stimulus-rich) to induce differential mood states.
""To induce a relatively more negative or more positive mood, the sheep had been subjected to either unpredictable, stimulus-poor or predictable, stimulus-rich housing conditions, respectively, since July 2011 (Vögeli et al., 2014).""
""To induce a negative mood, a group of 14 sheep was continuously housed in an enclosed deep-litter pen where feed, water and daylight were provided daily at unpredictable times. In contrast to the initial set of conditions, one of the subgroups now received feed at regular feeding times whereas the other subgroup needed to wait a random amount of time up to 2 h until feed was provided.""
""To induce a positive mood, 15 sheep were housed in a generous open-front pen with access to an exercise yard on work days between 08:15 and 17:30 h providing a natural daylight rhythm.

This quote further confirms that the same animals were exposed to both the control and space restriction conditions, rather than having separate groups of animals.

""During H4 we introduced two coconuts inside the metabolism pens as temporally unpredictable environmental enrichment, following Nogueira et al. (2011) , who showed that temporal unpredictability increases the exploratory behavior and activity of peccaries.""
This quote also indicates that the same animals were exposed to the space restriction condition with and without environmental enrichment, rather than having separate groups.

  - ""We compared the responses to ambiguous stimuli in a series of JBTs with birds housed in two environments -wire cages and deep litter pens (see Animals, housing and management for details).""",,"
To determine the study design, I will look for evidence in the paper of whether the same group of animals was subjected to different housing conditions sequentially (within-individual design) or if there were separate groups of animals subjected to different housing conditions simultaneously (between-individual design).

""In each of the four experiments the animals were divided into the two groups. The length of exposure of each group to different HMs, order of environment exchange and the timeline of behavioural tests is illustrated in Fig. 2 .""
This quote indicates that in each experiment, the animals were divided into two groups that were exposed to different housing manipulations (HM1 and HM2), with the order of the housing conditions being switched between the groups.

""We compared the responses to ambiguous stimuli in a series of JBTs with birds housed in two environments -wire cages and deep litter pens (see Animals, housing and management for details).""
This quote also confirms that the animals were housed in two different environments (wire cages and deep litter pens) and their responses were compared.

""The housing manipulation (HM) started after reaching the criterion in the discrimination training (Fig. 1 ).""
This quote indicates that the housing manipulation occurred after the initial discrimination training, suggesting a within-individual design where the same animals were exposed to different housing conditions sequentially.
