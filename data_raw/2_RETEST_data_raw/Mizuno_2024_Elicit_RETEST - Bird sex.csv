Body size affects the evolution of eyespots in caterpillars,"Thomas John Hossie, John Skelhorn, Jesse W Breinholt, Akito Y Kawahara, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,49,2015,Hossie_2015.pdf,NA,"  - ""Pastry caterpillars were deployed between 1600 and 1900 h on the first day of a replicate site. Specifically, 24 trees were selected along a linear transect (∼10 m apart), and to each tree a single artificial prey was pinned on the upper side of a live branch in each cardinal zone (north, south, east, and west) of a tree.""
  - ""Field trials were conducted at three sites in Ontario, Canada (site 1: near the Ferguson Forest Centre, Kemptville, 45°03'00""N, 75°39'44""W; site 2: University of Guelph, Kemptville campus, 44°59'48""N, 75°38'22""W; site 3: Oxford Mills, 44°56'27""N, 75°38'56""W). Experiments were run between May 7 and September 7, 2013. All three sites were composed of secondary growth mixed-deciduous forest, and no site was closer than 5.5 km to any other site. Insectivorous bird species observed in each of the field locations are detailed in Table S3""",,"
The paper does not mention the sex of the birds used in the field experiments. The only information provided about the birds is that they were ""insectivorous bird species"" observed at the field sites (Table S3). There are no details about the specific bird species or their sex. Therefore, the bird sex is not specified in this paper.

Deflective effect and the effect of prey detectability on anti-predator function of eyespots,"Adrian Vallin, Marina Dimitrova, Ullasa Kodandaramaiah, Sami Merilaita, D Kemp",-,-,Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology,37,2011,Vallin_2011.pdf,NA,"  - ""blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus)""
  - ""The birds were ringed and released at the site of their capture after use in the present study. All the birds maintained their condition and were healthy upon release.""
  - ""The experimental protocol and housing of birds was reviewed and approved by the regional ethical committee in Linköping (Dnr: 62-08). We caught blue tits at the research station using mist nets and housed them indoors in individual cages (80×60×40 cm).""",,"
The paper does not explicitly state the sex of the birds used in the experiments. However, it does mention that the study used ""blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus)"" as the predators. Blue tits are a species of small passerine bird, and both males and females have similar plumage coloration.
""We used wild caught blue tits, C. caeruleus, as predators, because they are insectivorous passerines and have been successfully used in previous predation experiments on butterflies and eyespots (e.g., Vallin et al. 2006, 2007).""

Eyespots interact with body colour to protect caterpillar-like prey from avian predators,"Thomas John Hossie, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,Animal Behaviour,36,2012,Hossie_2012.pdf,NA,"  - ""Insectivorous bird species observed in each of the field locations are detailed in Supplementary Table S2""",,"
The paper does not specify the sex of the birds that preyed on the artificial caterpillars. There are no quotes that indicate the sex of the birds involved in the study. The paper only mentions ""insectivorous birds"" and lists the bird species observed at the study sites, but does not provide any information about the sex of these birds.

Field experiments on the effectiveness of 'eyespots' as predator deterrents,"Martin Stevens, Elinor Hopkins, William Hinde, Amabel Adcock, Yvonne Connolly, Tom Troscianko, Innes C Cuthill, K T Troscianko",-,-,-,-,-,Stevens_2007.pdf,NA,,,"
The paper does not explicitly mention the sex of the birds used in the experiments. There are no quotes that directly state the sex of the birds. The paper focuses on the effectiveness of eyespots as predator deterrents, and does not provide any information about the sex of the avian predators involved.

Significance of butterfly eyespots as an anti-predator device in ground-based and aerial attacks,"Anne Lyytinen, Paul M Brakefield, Johanna Mappes",-,-,,91,2003,Lyytinen_2003.pdf,NA,"  - ""After the experiments, we released all birds.""

  - ""Pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) are small passerine birds that feed on insects and other arthropods catching them in the air, from foliage, or from the ground.""
  - ""pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca)""",,"
The paper does not explicitly mention the sex of the birds used in the experiments. The only information provided about the birds is that they were ""pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca)"", which is a species of small passerine bird. There is no indication that the sex of the individual birds was a factor in the study.

The Feeding Behaviour of Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) in the Presence of 'Eyes',"I R Inglis, L W Huson, M B Marshall, P A Arid,  Neville",-,-,-,-,-,Inglis_1983.pdf,both,"  - ""we compared the first principal component scores derived from the data of the initial control trials for males and females and found no significant differences.""
  - ""compared the first principal component scores derived from the data of the initial control trials for males and females and found no significant differences.""
  - ""only starlings in adult plumage were used in these experiments""",,"
The paper does not explicitly state the sex of the starling subjects used in the experiments. However, it does mention that ""only starlings in adult plumage were used in these experiments"" and that the researchers ""compared the first principal component scores derived from the data of the initial control trials for males and females and found no significant differences."" This suggests that both male and female starlings were used in the experiments, but their sex was not a factor in the analysis.

The position of eyespots and thickened segments influence their protective value to caterpillars,"John Skelhorn, Giles Dorrington, Thomas J Hossie, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,,15,2014,Skelhorn_2014.pdf,NA,"  - ""All chicks were marked with nontoxic ""child-friendly"" colored marker pens to enable individual identification: this did not appear to have any adverse effect in chick behavior.""
  - ""Fifty-nine newly hatched domestic chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus) of the ""Ross"" strain were purchased from a commercial hatchery in Berwickshire, UK.""",,"
The paper does not explicitly state the sex of the birds used in the experiments. However, it does provide some relevant information:
""Fifty-nine newly hatched domestic chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus) of the ""Ross"" strain were purchased from a commercial hatchery in Berwickshire, UK.""
This indicates that the birds used were chicks, but does not specify whether they were male or female. The paper also states:
""All chicks were marked with nontoxic ""child-friendly"" colored marker pens to enable individual identification: this did not appear to have any adverse effect in chick behavior.""
The use of the term ""chicks"" suggests that the birds were not yet sexually mature, so their sex may not have been a relevant factor in the study.

"The protective value of conspicuous signals is not impaired by shape, size, or position asymmetry","Martin Stevens, Sarah A Castor-Perry, Jessica R F Price",-,-,,19,2009,Stevens&CastorPerry_2009.pdf,NA,,,"
The paper does not mention the sex of the birds that were the predators in the experiments. The paper only refers to ""wild avian predators"" and ""small songbirds"" in the study site, without specifying the sex of these birds. There are no quotes that indicate the sex of the predatory birds used in the experiments.
