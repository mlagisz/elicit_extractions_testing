Eyespots interact with body colour to protect caterpillar-like prey from avian predators,"Thomas John Hossie, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,Animal Behaviour,36,2012,Hossie_2012.pdf,no,"  - ""our experimental design was approved by the Carleton University Research Ethics Committee (Protocol B10-14).""",,"
The paper does not mention anything about a registered protocol, pre-registration, or a pre-defined study plan. There are no quotes from the paper that indicate the study was registered or pre-registered.

The paper states that ""Our experimental design was approved by the Carleton University Research Ethics Committee (Protocol B10-14)."" However, this refers to the approval of the experimental design, not a pre-registered protocol.
