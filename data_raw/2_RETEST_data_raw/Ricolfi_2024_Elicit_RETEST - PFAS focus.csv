The paper is focused on investigating the association between maternal exposure to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes. This is evident from the title, abstract, and introduction of the paper:
""The first meta-analysis on maternal PFASs exposure and adverse pregnancy outcomes was performed.""
""Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and their derivatives are a class of persistent organic pollutants containing a hydrophobic chain fully or partially saturated with fluorine atoms.""
""This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to explore the association between maternal exposure to PFASs and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including miscarriage, stillbirth and preterm birth.""
The paper does not investigate any other chemicals besides PFASs. The focus is solely on the potential effects of maternal PFAS exposure on adverse pregnancy outcomes.
