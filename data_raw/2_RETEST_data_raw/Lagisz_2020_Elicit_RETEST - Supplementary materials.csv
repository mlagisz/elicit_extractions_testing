Validation of a novel cognitive bias task based on difference in quantity of reinforcement for assessing environmental enrichment,"Heidi A Keen, O Lynne Nelson, Charles T Robbins, Marc Evans, David J Shepherdson, Ruth C Newberry",-,-,-,-,-,Keen2014.pdf,yes,"  - ""An example of the training session is shown in Online Resource 1.""
  - ""Online Resource 2 shows an example of bears interacting with the cow hide enrichment item.""",,"
The paper mentions the existence of supplementary materials in the following quote:
""An example of the training session is shown in Online Resource 1.""
This indicates that there is at least one supplementary material, specifically an ""Online Resource 1"" that contains a video example of the training session.
Additionally, the paper states:
""Online Resource 2 shows an example of bears interacting with the cow hide enrichment item.""
This further confirms the existence of supplementary materials, in this case an ""Online Resource 2"" that contains a video of the bears interacting with the cow hide enrichment item.
