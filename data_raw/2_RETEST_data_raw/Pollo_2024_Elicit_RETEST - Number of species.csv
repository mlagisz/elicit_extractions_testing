Assortative Mating in Animals,"Yuexin Jiang, Daniel I Bolnick, Mark Kirkpatrick",-,-,American Naturalist,363,2013,Jiang_2013.pdf,254,"  - ""Our database contains 1,116 measurements of the strength of assortative mating from 254 species in five phyla""
  - ""We reviewed more than 13,000 publications. While the search was thorough, it is certain that there are publications that our search did not find. However, an exhaustive search is not necessary for meta-analysis, which is fundamentally a sampling activity intended to retrieve studies that are representative of the question of interest. Thus, a meta-analysis can yield accurate results if it is an unbiased sample from a large and representative literature.""",,"
The paper states that the meta-analysis included data from 254 species:
""Our database contains 1,116 measurements of the strength of assortative mating from 254 species in five phyla""
This is further confirmed in the following quote:
""We reviewed more than 13,000 publications. While the search was thorough, it is certain that there are publications that our search did not find. However, an exhaustive search is not necessary for meta-analysis, which is fundamentally a sampling activity intended to retrieve studies that are representative of the question of interest. Thus, a meta-analysis can yield accurate results if it is an unbiased sample from a large and representative literature.""
The paper also mentions excluding certain species from the analysis, but the final number of species included is stated as 254.

Darwinian sex roles confirmed across the animal kingdom,"Tim Janicke, Ines K Häderer, Marc J Lajeunesse, Nils Anthes",-,-,Science Advances,323,2016,Janicke_2016.pdf,66,"  - ""We identified 72 studies on 66 animal species, providing estimates of I, I s , and/or b ss for males and females (Fig. 1""
  - ""We retained a sample of n = 72 studies, covering 66 species and providing 81, 88, and 76 estimates (hereafter K) for male and female I, I s , and b ss , respectively (table S1""",,"
The paper states that the meta-analysis covered 66 animal species:
""We identified 72 studies on 66 animal species, providing estimates of I, I s , and/or b ss for males and females (Fig. 1).""
This is further confirmed in the supplementary materials:
""We retained a sample of n = 72 studies, covering 66 species and providing 81, 88, and 76 estimates (hereafter K) for male and female I, I s , and b ss , respectively (table S1).""
Therefore, the number of species used in the meta-analysis is 66.

Measuring and interpreting sexual selection metrics: evaluation and guidelines,"Nils Anthes, Ines K H € Aderer, Nico K Michiels, Tim Janicke",-,-,,41,2017,Anthes_2017.pdf,8,"  - ""we extracted effect sizes from eight studies, three of which provided estimates for both sexes.""
  - ""Our review illustrates this variation, using the Bateman gradient, a particularly prominent sexual selection metric.""
  - ""Drawing from a recent meta-analysis, we evaluate potential biases arising from study design, data collection and parameter estimation, and provide suggestions to mitigate such biases in future studies.""",,"
The paper does not explicitly state the number of species included in the meta-analysis or meta-regression. However, it does provide some relevant information:
""Drawing from a recent meta-analysis, we evaluate potential biases arising from study design, data collection and parameter estimation, and provide suggestions to mitigate such biases in future studies.""
This suggests that the paper is based on a meta-analysis, which would likely include multiple species.
""Our review illustrates this variation, using the Bateman gradient, a particularly prominent sexual selection metric.""
This indicates that the Bateman gradient, which is the focus of the paper, is a ""particularly prominent"" metric, implying that it has been studied across multiple species.
""We extracted effect sizes from eight studies, three of which provided estimates for both sexes.""
This quote directly states that the analysis included 8 studies, though it does not specify the number of species.

Mechanisms of Social Influence: A Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Social Information on Female Mate Choice Decisions,"Blake Carlton Jones, Emily H Duval",-,-,Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution,33,2019,Jones_2019.pdf,17,"  - ""However, studies that met our criteria of providing individual-level counts of mating choices represented only 17 total species.""",,"
The paper states that the meta-analysis included 17 species from 13 different families:
""Our meta-analysis included experiments on 17 species from 13 different families, representing three classes of arthropods and two classes of vertebrates.""
The paper also notes that this represents the taxonomic diversity covered in the studies that met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis:
""However, studies that met our criteria of providing individual-level counts of mating choices represented only 17 total species.""
Therefore, the number of species included in the meta-analysis/meta-regression is 17.

No evidence of immediate fitness benefits of within-season divorce in monogamous birds,"Antica Culina, Lyanne Brouwer",-,-,Biology Letters,5,2022,Culina_2022.pdf,24,"  - ""Our full dataset included 31 relevant studies on 24 socially monogamous bird species (table 1 for summary, and data tables), belonging to six bird orders (15 to Passerifomes; five to Charadriiformes, one each to Falconifomes, Piciformes, Strigifomes and Suliformes).""",,"
The paper states that the full dataset included 31 relevant studies on 24 socially monogamous bird species:
""Our full dataset included 31 relevant studies on 24 socially monogamous bird species (table 1 for summary, and data tables), belonging to six bird orders (15 to Passerifomes; five to Charadriiformes, one each to Falconifomes, Piciformes, Strigifomes and Suliformes).""
This directly answers the question of the number of species used in the meta-analysis/meta-regression.

The relative importance of size and asymmetry in sexual selection,"R Thornhid', A P M0ller, A P Moller",-,-,,87,1998,Thornhill_1998.pdf,29,"  - ""We collected information on the relationship between success in sexual competition and size and asymmetry, respectively, to assess the relative importance of these two factors in sexual selection. Studies that allowed comparison of the relationships for the same traits' size and symmetry and success in sexual competition constituted the data, which totaled 73 samples from 33 studies of 29 species.""",,"
The paper states the number of species included in the meta-analysis:

Variation in pre-and post-copulatory sexual selection on male genital size in two species of lygaeid bug,"Liam R Dougherty, David M Shuker",-,-,Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology,18,2016,Dougherty_2016.pdf,2,"  - ""We present the results of two experiments. In the first, we correlated processus length with male reproductive success using a sample of L. equestris males used in a previous experiment in which mating trials were performed using four experimental choice designs (Dougherty and Shuker 2014). We then performed a second experiment in L. simulans in which male reproductive success was recorded in no-choice mating trials.""
  - ""Lygaeus equestris L. and L. simulans Deckert are two closely related species of lygaeid bug (Heteroptera: Lygaeiodea; Lygaeinae). Both species are behaviourally and morphologically very similar.""",,"
The paper focuses on two closely related species of lygaeid bug, Lygaeus equestris and Lygaeus simulans. This is evident from the following quotes:
""Lygaeus equestris L. and L. simulans Deckert are two closely related species of lygaeid bug (Heteroptera: Lygaeiodea; Lygaeinae). Both species are behaviourally and morphologically very similar.""
""We present the results of two experiments. In the first, we correlated processus length with male reproductive success using a sample of L. equestris males used in a previous experiment in which mating trials were performed using four experimental choice designs (Dougherty and Shuker 2014). We then performed a second experiment in L. simulans in which male reproductive success was recorded in no-choice mating trials.""
""To expand on the earlier study by Tadler (1999) by also recording male mating success. For both species, we thus compared the strength and pattern of selection on processus length both before and during/after mating.""
Therefore, the number of species used in this study is 2.
