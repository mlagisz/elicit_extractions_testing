The paper does not explicitly state the type of light sources used in the experiment. However, it provides some relevant details about the lighting conditions:
""All animals were housed individually in transparent polysulfone cages (43 cm×27 cm×18 cm) containing a thin layer of rice bran as bedding material and maintained under standard laboratory condition with ambient temperature of 25 ± 2°C and 12:12 h LD (light -250 lux, 04.00 h to 16.00 h) (dark -0 lux, 16.00 h to 04.00 h) cycle provided with ad libitum access to standard rodent chow and water.""
This quote indicates that the animals were exposed to a 12:12 hour light-dark cycle, with the light phase being 250 lux. The paper does not specify the type of light source used to provide this lighting.
""Chronic LL caused a similar response in both squirrels and mice: it decreased sucrose preference, melatonin, CAT and SOD levels but increased corticosterone and TNF-α levels.""
This quote refers to the ""constant light"" (LL) condition, but again does not specify the type of light source.
""Behavioral tests and sample collections were conducted in a light condition similar to the experimental housing environment of the LD, DD, and LL groups.""
This quote indicates that the lighting used for behavioral tests and sample collection matched the lighting conditions of the experimental groups, but does not provide any details about the light sources.

""On day 22 (23 August) half of the lizards were exposed to 24,100 lux of fluorescent plus incandescent illumination from 2 to 4 p.m. while the other half remained in the dark.""
This quote mentions that the lizards were exposed to a combination of fluorescent and incandescent illumination.

""To avoid heat stress the sun-exposed lizards were misted at 10 min intervals.""

The paper does not explicitly state the type of light sources used in the experiments. However, it provides some relevant details about the lighting conditions:

""Nighttime samples were taken using a dim red light (maximum intensity 10 lx).""

""Commencing at 18:00 hr on March 30, the lizards were released into LL (2000 lx) and sampled for blood 3 days later commencing at 08:00 hr on April 1.""
This quote mentions that the lizards were exposed to ""LL"" (constant light) with an intensity of 2000 lx, but does not specify the type of light source.

""Experiments were conducted in the austral spring to autumn (November to May).""
This quote suggests the experiments were conducted in a natural setting, rather than a laboratory with artificial lighting. However, it does not provide any information about the specific light sources used.

Based on the information provided in the paper, the type of light sources used is unclear. The paper does not mention the use of any specific types of lamps such as LED, fluorescent, or halogen. The lighting conditions are described in terms of light intensity (lx) and photoperiod (12L:12D, LL), but the light sources themselves are not specified.
