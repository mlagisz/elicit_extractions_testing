The paper does not mention anything about a registered protocol, pre-registration, or a pre-defined study plan. There are no quotes that indicate the study was registered or based on a pre-defined protocol.

The paper states the following about the methods:
""The systematic review and meta-analysis was performed according to the general principles recommended in the Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology consensus statement and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) criteria (Fig. 1 ) (Ziegler et al., 2011).""
This suggests the study followed established guidelines for systematic reviews and meta-analyses, but does not indicate the study was registered or based on a pre-defined protocol.

No

The paper does not provide any information about a registered protocol, pre-registration, or a pre-defined study plan. The methods section indicates the study followed established guidelines for systematic reviews and meta-analyses, but does not mention any kind of registration or pre-defined protocol. Therefore, I am confident the answer is ""No"".
