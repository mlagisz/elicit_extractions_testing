The paper states that the researchers measured melatonin levels in the birds' plasma:
""Plasma MEL concentrations were measured by direct radioimmunoassay [41], which has been validated for zebra finches [42].""
The paper also mentions that blood samples were collected from the wing vein:
""Blood was collected from the wing vein into microhematocrit-heparinized capillary tubes (Marienfeld, Germany) and immediately put on ice. Plasma was separated by centrifugation for 8 min at 4000 rpm and kept at -80 0 C until analysed.""
There is no mention of the researchers measuring melatonin levels in any other tissues such as the pineal gland, suprachiasmatic nucleus, urine, retina, or water. The paper clearly states that melatonin was measured in the birds' plasma.

Can skyglow reduce nocturnal melatonin concentrations in Eurasian perch? *,"Franziska Kupprat, Franz H € Olker, Werner Kloas, Sarah Harmon",-,-,Environmental Pollution,38,2020,Kupprat_2020.pdf,water,"  - ""Circulating melatonin is partially released into the surrounding water via the gills, which can be used for noninvasive water-based measurements of melatonin (Ellis et al., 2005;James et al., 2004).""
  - ""Each water sample was pre-filtered (glass fiber filters, 0.7 mm) and pumped through SPE cartridges (Oasis HBL, Waters, Milford, MA, USA) at a rate of 25 mL min À1 .

After pumping the sample, cartridges were washed once more with 5 mL distilled water and eluted with ethyl acetate. Extracts were evaporated under a stream of nitrogen at 45 C and the dried extracts were stored at À20 C. For analysis the dried extracts were re-dissolved in 0.1 M PBS buffer containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 5% ethanol.

The paper states that melatonin was measured in the tank water, not in any tissue from the fish:

The paper also mentions that melatonin is released into the surrounding water via the gills:
""Circulating melatonin is partially released into the surrounding water via the gills, which can be used for noninvasive water-based measurements of melatonin (Ellis et al., 2005;James et al., 2004).""
Therefore, the tissue measured for melatonin levels in this study was the tank water, not any tissue from the fish.

LIGHT AT NIGHT CANNOT SUPPRESS PINEAL MELATONIN LEVELS IN THE LIZARD ANOLZS CAROLZNENSZS,Herbert Underwcod,-,-,-,-,-,Underwood_1986.pdf,pineal,"  - ""All lizards were killed at 3 p.m. and the pineals were removed, placed in chilled PBS buffer, stored at -20°C and subsequently assayed for melatonin via RIA as described previously (Underwood et al., 1984).""
