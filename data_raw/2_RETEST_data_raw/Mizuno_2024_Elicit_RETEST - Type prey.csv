Body size affects the evolution of eyespots in caterpillars,"Thomas John Hossie, John Skelhorn, Jesse W Breinholt, Akito Y Kawahara, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,49,2015,Hossie_2015.pdf,artificial,"  - ""Artificial caterpillars were designed to quantify the selective advantage of eyespots on large and small prey. Construction of artificial caterpillars followed a methodology similar to that used in previous studies (11,12).""
  - ""The dark and light pastries were rolled into strips of 3.5 mm diameter for small prey and 5 mm diameter for large prey, and then cut into lengths of 20 mm for small prey and 40 mm for large prey. Two-toned (i.e., countershaded) prey were then created by pressing together one piece of dark pastry and one piece of light pastry, such that the final artificial prey were cylinders 20 mm long × 5 mm diameter for small prey and 40 mm × 7 mm for large prey.""
  - ""Pastry caterpillars were manufactured with a 3:1 mixture of white flour and lard. Light-green pastry was produced by adding three drops of Leaf Green AmeriColor Soft Gel Paste (AmeriColor) and 20 mL of water to 40 mL of lard and 118 mL flour; dark-green pastry was produced by adding six drops of gel paste and 15 mL of water to the same volumes of flour and lard.""",,"
The paper indicates that the authors used artificial caterpillar models in both their field and laboratory experiments. In the field experiment, the authors describe the construction of ""Pastry caterpillars"" made from a mixture of flour and lard, with the models being countershaded and some having eyespots painted on them. In the laboratory experiment, the authors used similar artificial caterpillar models made from pastry.

Deflective effect and the effect of prey detectability on anti-predator function of eyespots,"Adrian Vallin, Marina Dimitrova, Ullasa Kodandaramaiah, Sami Merilaita, D Kemp",-,-,Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology,37,2011,Vallin_2011.pdf,artificial,"  - ""artificial, triangular prey items""
  - ""we used artificial, triangular prey items and blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) as predators.""
  - ""The prey items were isosceles triangular (b × h: 30×15 mm 2 ), and their grey ground color was identical to the grey of the concealing background (Fig. 1b, c ). In addition, there were three lines and nine dots, identical to the lines and dots of the concealing background, randomly distributed on each prey item.""",,"
The paper states that the authors used ""artificial, triangular prey items"" for their experiments:
""We used artificial, triangular prey items and blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) as predators.""
The paper also provides details on how the prey items were made:
""The prey items were isosceles triangular (b × h: 30×15 mm 2 ), and their grey ground color was identical to the grey of the concealing background (Fig. 1b, c ). In addition, there were three lines and nine dots, identical to the lines and dots of the concealing background, randomly distributed on each prey item.""
From these quotes, it is clear that the authors used artificial, geometrical prey items rather than real butterflies or moths. The prey items were triangular in shape and had a grey ground color with additional patterning elements.

Eyespots interact with body colour to protect caterpillar-like prey from avian predators,"Thomas John Hossie, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,Animal Behaviour,36,2012,Hossie_2012.pdf,artificial,"  - ""Artificial caterpillars were designed to assess the protective value of eyespots and countershading on caterpillar prey in general; however, for ecological relevance, our prey were modelled loosely on Papilio canadensis.""
  - ""Finished pastry caterpillars (e.g. Fig. 1 ) were checked against a standard model prey for each treatment to ensure uniformity in size and shape of the body, as well as the size and position of eyespots.""
  - ""Specifically, pastry caterpillars were manufactured with a 3:1 mixture of white flour (White RoseÔ, White Rose Flour Mills, Byford, WA, U.S.A.) and lard (TenderflakeÔ, Maple Leaf Foods, Toronto, ON, Canada).""",,"

The paper clearly states that the authors used artificial, pastry-based caterpillar prey rather than real caterpillars.

The paper indicates that the authors used artificial ""moth-like stimuli"" rather than real butterflies or moths. This is evident from the following quotes:

Significance of butterfly eyespots as an anti-predator device in ground-based and aerial attacks,"Anne Lyytinen, Paul M Brakefield, Johanna Mappes",-,-,,91,2003,Lyytinen_2003.pdf,real,"  - ""To test whether eyespots affect the escape probability of butterflies after the attack, three forms (spotless, spotted, Bigeye-comet) of B. anynana differing in eyespot pattern, were placed one at a time on the slice of banana into the cages in the presence of a lizard.""
  - ""Bicyclus anynana (Satyrinae) shows variation in number, size, shape, colour composition, and position of eyespots (Brakefield and French 1999). For its natural range, in central Africa, an alternation of warm, wet and cool, dry seasons is characteristic. The larvae respond to high or low rearing temperatures by developing the spotted or spotless wings of the adult, respectively (Brakefield andLarsen 1984, Brakefield andReitsma 1991). The wet season form has seven eyespots on its hindwings and two on its forewings (Fig. 1 ). In the dry season form these eyespots are reduced in size or totally absent, the wings being uniformly brown. Furthermore, the resting butterfly covers the posterior forewing spot with its hindwings. In addition, we used a double mutant line, Bigeye-comet, in which all the eyespots are larger in size than in the wet season form.""",,"
The paper indicates that the authors used live specimens of the butterfly species Bicyclus anynana, as well as a mutant line of the same species called ""Bigeye-comet"" which had larger eyespots. This is evident from the following quotes:

The Feeding Behaviour of Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) in the Presence of 'Eyes',"I R Inglis, L W Huson, M B Marshall, P A Arid,  Neville",-,-,-,-,-,Inglis_1983.pdf,artificial,"  - ""The four stimuli were a) a blank card; b) two crosses arranged horizontally 6 cm apart, each measuring 2 x~ 2 cm; c) two triangular eyes arranged 6 cm apart, each consisting of an equilateral trianslc having sides 2 c m long and containing a black triangular 'pupil'; d) two circular eyes arranged 6 cm apart, each consisting of a circle of 2 cm diameter containing 1 cm diameter black 'pupil'.""",,"
The paper does not mention using any real butterfly, moth, or caterpillar species or patterns. Instead, it describes using various artificial eye-like patterns drawn on white boards, such as:
""The four stimuli were a) a blank card; b) two crosses arranged horizontally 6 cm apart, each measuring 2 x~ 2 cm; c) two triangular eyes arranged 6 cm apart, each consisting of an equilateral trianslc having sides 2 c m long and containing a black triangular 'pupil'; d) two circular eyes arranged 6 cm apart, each consisting of a circle of 2 cm diameter containing 1 cm diameter black 'pupil'.""
The paper also mentions using a ""pair of 2-cm diameter eyes with 1 cm diameter 'pupils', arranged horizontally 6 cm apart"" and other artificial eye-like patterns.
