Impacts of heat waves and corresponding measures: a review,"Jian Zuo, Stephen Pullen, Jasmine Palmer, Helen Bennetts, Nicholas Chileshe, Tony Ma",-,-,,231,2015,Zuo_2015.pdf,no,"  - ""The organization of this paper is as follows. The second chapter provides the methodology employed in this paper to identify and analyse literature related to heat waves. This is followed by a review of various definitions of heat waves. The fourth chapter reveals impacts of heat waves on human health and ecosystems. The fifth chapter reviews the mechanisms available to deal with these impacts. The sixth chapter identifies the implications of the extensive review conducted in this study, particularly for the building design of dwellings. Finally, the conclusions are drawn together with the identification of future research directions.""
  - ""The aim of this research is to present a critical review of impacts of heat waves and corresponding mechanisms. A list of keywords was used to search related papers and reports. These keywords include: extreme weather conditions; heat waves; hot spell; health; overheating; mechanisms; building, etc. As a result, 173 papers and reports were selected to be critically reviewed in this study.""
  - ""This paper reports on a critical literature review which covers the following main aspects: (1) the definition of heat waves; (2) the impacts of heat waves on health, ecosystems and the built environment;

(3) the current mechanisms to deal with impacts of heat waves.""",,"
