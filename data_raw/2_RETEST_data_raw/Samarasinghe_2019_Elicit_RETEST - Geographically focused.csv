Built environmental correlates of older adults' total physical activity and walking: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"David W Barnett, Anthony Barnett, Andrea Nathan, Jelle Van Cauwenberg, Ester Cerin",-,-,-,-,-,Barnett_2017.pdf,no,"  - ""One postulated reason for the lack of consistent significant associations between environmental correlates and PA was the relative 'western' bias of the reviewed research -68% of the 31 articles reviewed by Van Cauwenberg and colleagues were from North America alone [15]. This is an important limitation since homogenously low-density western cities lack environmental variability potentially resulting in the underestimation of the strength of associations between the built environment and PA. Also, western cities differ from the built environments of Africa, Asia, and South America, limiting the generalizability of findings [16][17][18].

The paper states that the review aimed to provide a ""timely, robust overview of studies that investigated associations of built environmental attributes and estimates of total PA, including total walking."" It does not specify that the review was geographically focused on any particular region or country. In fact, the paper notes that the previous review by Van Cauwenberg et al. in 2011 had a ""western bias"" with 68% of the studies coming from North America, and that this review aimed to include more evidence from non-Western countries to address this limitation:

""One postulated reason for the lack of consistent significant associations between environmental correlates and PA was the relative 'western' bias of the reviewed research -68% of the 31 articles reviewed by Van Cauwenberg and colleagues were from North America alone [15].

Furthermore, the inclusion criteria for the review did not specify that only studies from particular geographic regions were eligible. The paper states:

""Article eligibility for inclusion was based on the following criteria: (1) published in English between 1st January 2000 and 3rd September 2016; (2) quantitative study; (3) study with a cross-sectional, longitudinal or quasi-experimental design; (4) a sample with a mean age ≥ 65 years; (5) investigated the association between any objective or perceived attribute of the built environment and objectively measured or self-reported PA and/or walking that was not specific to a single PA domain only; (6) did not exclusively focus on clinical populations (e.g., overweight, disabled or institutionalised participants); and (7) did not investigate associations between PA and the built environment with an ill-defined aggregated environmental measure that, for example, combined two weakly correlated attributes such as access to/availability of recreational facilities and traffic/ pedestrian safety.""

Impacts of heat waves and corresponding measures: a review,"Jian Zuo, Stephen Pullen, Jasmine Palmer, Helen Bennetts, Nicholas Chileshe, Tony Ma",-,-,,231,2015,Zuo_2015.pdf,no,"  - ""This review provides useful inputs to both policy making and industry practice on improving the resilience of urban and regional areas in the event of extreme weather conditions such as heat waves in the future.""
  - ""It is identified in the WMO report that Australia is one of the regions which is particularly susceptible to heat waves and drought conditions.""
  - ""Heat waves have significant impacts on both ecosystems and human beings. This is compounded by future climate scenarios which indicate more frequent and severe heat waves in certain locations.""",,"
The paper does not explicitly state that the review is geographically focused on a particular region. The abstract mentions that heat waves have significant impacts on both ecosystems and human beings, and that this is compounded by future climate scenarios which indicate more frequent and severe heat waves in certain locations. However, it does not specify that the review is limited to a particular geographic region.
""Heat waves have significant impacts on both ecosystems and human beings. This is compounded by future climate scenarios which indicate more frequent and severe heat waves in certain locations.""
The paper also mentions that Australia is one of the regions which is particularly susceptible to heat waves and drought conditions, and that the review provides useful inputs to both policy making and industry practice on improving the resilience of urban and regional areas in the event of extreme weather conditions such as heat waves in the future.
