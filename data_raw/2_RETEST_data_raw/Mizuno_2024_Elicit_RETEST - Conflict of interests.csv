Eyespots interact with body colour to protect caterpillar-like prey from avian predators,"Thomas John Hossie, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,Animal Behaviour,36,2012,Hossie_2012.pdf,not declared specifically,"  - ""To determine whether constantly displayed eyespots were effective in deterring avian predation and/or deflecting strikes, we deployed artificial caterpillars in the field and monitored their 'survival'.""

Significance of butterfly eyespots as an anti-predator device in ground-based and aerial attacks,"Anne Lyytinen, Paul M Brakefield, Johanna Mappes",-,-,,91,2003,Lyytinen_2003.pdf,not declared specifically,"  - ""We did not find eyespots to be advantageous to butterflies when the attack came from the ground level or from above. In neither experiment did eyespot patterns increase the escape probability of butterflies once captured.""
  - ""We suggest two possible alternative hypotheses to account for the occurrence of spotted and spotless butterfly forms.""
  - ""To test the deflection hypothesis, we compared the survival of the spotless dry season form and spotted wet season form of Bicyclus anynana and examined the target of initial strike. We used two model predators: lizards (Anolis carolinensis) and pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) that are visually hunting insectivorous predators.""",,"
The paper does not mention any conflict of interests. There are no quotes that indicate the authors disclosed any potential conflicts of interest. The paper focuses on reporting the results of their experiments on the function of eyespots in butterflies as an anti-predator mechanism, without any discussion of potential conflicts of interest.
