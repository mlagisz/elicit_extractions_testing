Artificial light at night affects brain plasticity and melatonin in birds,"Stan Moaraf, Yulia Vistoropsky, Tatyana Pozner, Rachel Heiblum, Monika Okuliarová, Michal Zeman, Anat Barnea",-,-,Neuroscience Letters,48,2019,Moaraf_2019.pdf,Israel,"  - ""Adult female zebra finches were reared outdoor at the Meier Segals Garden for Zoological Research at Tel-Aviv University, Israel.""

  - ""The experiment consisted of four groups (see below), six birds per group. Zebra finches are very social species. Therefore, birds in each group were kept in one cage (67 × 33 × 33 cm), to avoid isolation stress.

To determine the location of the study, I will look for any explicit mentions of the country or location where the experiments were conducted or where the animals were collected. The paper mentions several locations:

""Freshly collected anoles were placed under stockroom conditions on 26 June 1985.""
This suggests the animals were collected from the wild, but does not specify the location.

""Freshly collected anoles were placed under stockroom conditions on 26 July 1985.""
This is another mention of freshly collected anoles, again without specifying the location.

""Freshly collected anoles were placed under stockroom conditions on 26 July 1985. On 2 August 1985 lizards were placed in terraria in one of two 'C' chambers in the Phytotron on the NCSU campus.""
