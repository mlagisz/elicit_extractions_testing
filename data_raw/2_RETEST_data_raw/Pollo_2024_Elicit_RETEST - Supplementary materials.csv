This quote directly states that there is supplementary material available for this article, and provides a link to access it.

Additionally, the paper mentions that there are supplementary figures included as part of the supplementary material:

""Fig. S1 . PRISMA diagram depicting the data flow through the different phases of the meta-analysis.""

""Fig. S2 . Correlations between the three Bateman metrics.""
