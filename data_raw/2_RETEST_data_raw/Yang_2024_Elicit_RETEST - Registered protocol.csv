Can skyglow reduce nocturnal melatonin concentrations in Eurasian perch? *,"Franziska Kupprat, Franz H € Olker, Werner Kloas, Sarah Harmon",-,-,Environmental Pollution,38,2020,Kupprat_2020.pdf,no,"  - ""The experiment was done according to the setup and procedure of Brüning et al. (2015). The light intensities were further dimmed down to 0.1 lx and 0.01 lx by partially covering the light source with tape and neutral density filter foil. Everything else was replicated with great care to ensure comparability of the results.""
