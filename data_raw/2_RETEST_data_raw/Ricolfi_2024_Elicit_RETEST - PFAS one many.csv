Association between maternal exposure to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances and risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Zhuoma Deji, Peng Liu, Xin Wang, Xin Zhang, Yuehua Luo, Zhenzhen Huang",-,-,Science of the Total Environment,39,2021,Deji_2021.pdf,multiple,,,"
The paper focuses on multiple types of PFAS substances, including:
Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and their derivatives are a class of persistent organic pollutants containing a hydrophobic chain fully or partially saturated with fluorine atoms.
The paper specifically examines the following PFAS compounds:
PFOS, PFOA, PFNA, PFDA, PFHxS, PFUnA, PFDeA
The paper states:
Twenty-one studies evaluating the influence of PFASs exposure and risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes were included in this meta-analysis.
There are sixteen, sixteen, eight and eight studies that assessed the relationship between maternal PFOA, PFOS, PFNA and PFHxS exposure and preterm birth, respectively.
The paper examines multiple PFAS compounds in relation to adverse pregnancy outcomes, rather than focusing on just one PFAS type.

""For all other prenatal PFAS including PFDA, PFUnDA, and PFHxS, there were no significant associations in terms of changes in weight in children before 2 years of age.""

The review covers a wide range of PFAS substances, including both long-chain PFAS like PFOA and PFOS, as well as short-chain PFAS like PFBA, PFPeA, and PFBS. While PFOA and PFOS were the most frequently evaluated, the review also examined the effects of other PFAS types.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANT EXPOSURES AND PRETERM BIRTH: A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW,"Kelly K Ferguson, Marie S O'neill, John D Meeker",-,-,"Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health. Part B, Critical Reviews",146,2013,Ferguson_2013.pdf,multiple,,,"
The review focuses on two main types of PFAS: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS). This is evident from the following quotes:
Perfluorinated chemicals repel oil, grease, and water and are used to treat carpets and clothing to prevent stains, and are also components of some food containers and wrappers (ATSDR, 2009) . Through product use and manufacturing they can be released into the environment, and do not degrade in soil or water. Exposure occurs through consumption of contaminated drinking water and food, inadvertent ingestion of indoor dust, and potentially through inhalation (ATSDR, 2009) . The two compounds produced in largest quantities include perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS).
Several recent studies examined the relationship between PFOA and PFOS exposure and preterm birth.
Four studies examined associations in populations where exposure levels were relatively low and on the same order of magnitude as those observed in the general U.S. population. Apelberg et al. (2007) measured PFOA and PFOS levels in cord serum from newborns in the Baltimore THREE study, where a relatively high proportion of births were preterm (n = 293, preterm = 28). No significant differences in median concentrations were detected, however, in term compared to preterm samples.

Human exposure pathways to poly-and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from indoor media: A systematic review,"Nicole M Deluca, Jeffrey M Minucci, Ashley Mullikin, Rachel Slover, Elaine A Cohen Hubal, Adrian Covaci, B S T R A C T",-,-,-,-,-,DeLuca_2022.pdf,multiple,"  - ""This systematic review adapted existing tools and methodologies to investigate the importance of PFAS exposure pathways from indoor and residential media including consumer products, household articles, cleaning products, personal care products, and indoor air and dust.""

The systematic review focuses on multiple types of PFAS chemicals, specifically:
""This systematic review (SR) synthesizes evidence for exposure from indoor residential pathways to inform understanding of variability in serum PFAS levels in the general population from sources other than drinking water and diet. A subset of well-studied substancesperfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA)were targeted in the literature for subsequent analysis.""
The review explicitly states that it is focused on a ""subset of well-studied"" PFAS chemicals, including PFOA, PFOS, PFBA, PFBS, PFDA, PFHxA, PFHxS, and PFNA. This indicates that the review is examining multiple types of PFAS, not just a single PFAS chemical.
""Serum concentrations reported in the included studies were PFOA (7 studies), PFOS (7 studies), PFNA (7 studies), PFHxS (5 studies), PFHxA (1 study), and PFBS (1 study).""
The results section further confirms that the review examined multiple PFAS chemicals, with data reported for PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, PFHxS, PFHxA, and PFBS.
""This systematic review adapted existing tools and methodologies to investigate the importance of PFAS exposure pathways from indoor and residential media including consumer products, household articles, cleaning products, personal care products, and indoor air and dust.""
The review also examined multiple indoor exposure media, not just a single source, further indicating a focus on multiple PFAS chemicals.

Legacy and emerging pollutants in Latin America: A critical review of occurrence and levels in environmental and food samples,"Cristina Marília,  Oliveira Souza, Bruno Alves Rocha, Joseph A Adeyemi, Martí Nadal, José Luis Domingo, Fernando Barbosa, Damià Barceló",-,-,Science of the Total Environment,51,2022,Souza_2022.pdf,multiple,"  - ""There are still gaps in Latin America's PFAS, EDCs, and illicit drug studies.""",,"
The paper does not focus on any specific PFAS compounds or provide a comprehensive review of PFAS in Latin America. The paper states:
""There are still gaps in Latin America's PFAS, EDCs, and illicit drug studies.""
This indicates that the paper acknowledges a lack of information on PFAS in the region, but does not provide any details or synthesis on PFAS occurrence or levels. The paper is more focused on providing an overview of a wide range of legacy and emerging pollutants in Latin America, without delving deeply into any one chemical class.
