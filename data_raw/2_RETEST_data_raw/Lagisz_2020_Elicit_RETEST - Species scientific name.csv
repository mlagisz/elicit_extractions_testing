Can the way pigs are handled alter behavioural and physiological measures of affective state?,"Ricard Carreras, Laura Arroyo, Eva Mainau, Daniel Valent, Anna Bassols, Antoni Dalmau, Luigi Faucitano, Xavier Manteca, Antonio Velarde",-,-,Behavioural Processes,16,2017,Carreras2017.pdf,Not mentioned (the scientific name of the species used in the study is not explicitly provided in the paper),"  - ""In this study, 56 female pigs ((Landrace x Large White) x Piétrain) were used.""
  - ""Pigs were inspected daily and no health problems were observed during the experimental period.""",,"
To determine the species scientific name used in this study, I will look for any explicit mentions of the species or breed of pigs used. The paper states:
""In this study, 56 female pigs ((Landrace x Large White) x Piétrain) were used.""
This indicates that the pigs used in the study were a cross between Landrace, Large White, and Piétrain breeds. However, the scientific name for the species is not explicitly provided.
""Pigs were inspected daily and no health problems were observed during the experimental period.""
This further confirms that the study used domestic pigs, but does not give the scientific name.

The paper states that the study used ""40 growing pigs (Large White × Landrace)"" as the study subjects. This indicates that the scientific name of the species used in the experiment is Sus scrofa domesticus, which is the domestic pig.

  - ""At 9 weeks of age, pigs were transported from a commercial farm to the experimental facilities of IRTA (Monells, Spain) and housed separately by gender and genotype in 8 pens (6 pigs per pen).""
  - ""A total of 48 pigs, in terms of 12Hal-free gilts (NNG), 12Hal carrier gilts (NnG), and 12Hal-free entire males (NNEM) and 12Hal carrier entire males (NnEM) were put on the CBT at the age of 20 weeks and on the NOT four days later.""",,"
The paper does not explicitly state the scientific name of the species used in the experiment, but based on the details provided, it appears to be the domestic pig (Sus scrofa domesticus). This can be inferred from the following quotes:
""A total of 48 pigs, in terms of 12Hal-free gilts (NNG), 12Hal carrier gilts (NnG), and 12Hal-free entire males (NNEM) and 12Hal carrier entire males (NnEM) were put on the CBT at the age of 20 weeks and on the NOT four days later.""
""At 9 weeks of age, pigs were transported from a commercial farm to the experimental facilities of IRTA (Monells, Spain) and housed separately by gender and genotype in 8 pens (6 pigs per pen).""

The scientific name of the animal species used in this experiment is explicitly stated in the paper:
""Here, using 96 C57BL/6 and SWISS female mice, respectively, we systematically varied environmental enrichment across four levels spanning the range of common enrichment strategies:""
""The mouse, Mus musculus, is the most widely used animal in research, and yet surprisingly little is known about how its behavioral biology relates to the social and physical aspects of current laboratory housing conditions (Latham and Mason, 2004).""
""Subjects were 192 female mice, 96 each of the inbred strain C57BL/6JRj (C57) and the outbred strain RjOrl:SWISS (SWISS) from Janvier Labs, France.""
