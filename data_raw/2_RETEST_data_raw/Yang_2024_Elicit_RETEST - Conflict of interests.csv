To determine the conflict of interests in this paper, I will look for a section or statement that explicitly addresses any potential conflicts of interest. The paper includes a section at the end titled ""Conflict of interests"" which states:

""The authors report no conflicts of interest.""

This quote directly states that the authors declare no conflicts of interest. The authors have explicitly disclosed that there are no conflicts of interest to report.

LIGHT AT NIGHT CANNOT SUPPRESS PINEAL MELATONIN LEVELS IN THE LIZARD ANOLZS CAROLZNENSZS,Herbert Underwcod,-,-,-,-,-,Underwood_1986.pdf,not declared specifically,"  - ""The present study was undertaken to discriminate between these two possibilities by observing the effects of high intensity (natural and artificial) light pulses on night time pineal melatonin levels in Anolis.""
  - ""The response of the Anolis pineal to acute night interruption is in contrast to that observed in birds and mammals.""
  - ""The pineal melatonin rhythm in Anolis can be entrained by either 24 hr light or temperature cycles (Underwood, 1985).""",,"
The paper does not mention any conflict of interest. There are no statements or disclosures about the authors having any conflicts of interest related to this study. The paper focuses entirely on the scientific findings and does not discuss any potential conflicts.
