Body size affects the evolution of eyespots in caterpillars,"Thomas John Hossie, John Skelhorn, Jesse W Breinholt, Akito Y Kawahara, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,49,2015,Hossie_2015.pdf,Not mentioned (none),"  - ""Finished pastry caterpillars were checked against a standard model prey for each treatment to ensure uniformity of size and shape of the body, as well as of the size and position of eyespots.""
  - ""Pastry caterpillars were manufactured with a 3:1 mixture of white flour and lard.""
  - ""Artificial caterpillars were designed to quantify the selective advantage of eyespots on large and small prey.""",,"
The paper does not mention the specific prey species used in the experiments. Instead, it refers to ""caterpillars"" and ""artificial caterpillars"" that were used as the prey models. There are no Latin binomial names provided for the prey species. The paper states:

""Artificial caterpillars were designed to quantify the selective advantage of eyespots on large and small prey.""
""Pastry caterpillars were manufactured with a 3:1 mixture of white flour and lard.""
""Finished pastry caterpillars were checked against a standard model prey for each treatment to ensure uniformity of size and shape of the body, as well as of the size and position of eyespots.""

Since the paper does not provide any Latin binomial names for the prey species, the answer is ""none"".

The paper does not mention the Latin binomial name of any prey species used in the experiments. Instead, it states that the researchers used ""artificial, triangular prey items"" made of printed paper:
""We used artificial, triangular prey items and blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) as predators.""
The paper also mentions that the prey items were ""isosceles triangular (b × h: 30×15 mm 2 ), and their grey ground color was identical to the grey of the concealing background (Fig. 1b, c).""
""The prey items were isosceles triangular (b × h: 30×15 mm 2 ), and their grey ground color was identical to the grey of the concealing background (Fig. 1b, c).""

Eyespots interact with body colour to protect caterpillar-like prey from avian predators,"Thomas John Hossie, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,Animal Behaviour,36,2012,Hossie_2012.pdf,Papilio canadensis,"  - ""modelled loosely on Papilio canadensis.""
  - ""Papilio canadensis, caterpillars could be found in the wild in our study area (Hall et al. 1996; T. J. Hossie, personal observation).""
  - ""Artificial caterpillars were designed to assess the protective value of eyespots and countershading on caterpillar prey in general; however, for ecological relevance, our prey were modelled loosely on Papilio canadensis.""
  - ""Specifically, pastry caterpillars were manufactured with a 3:1 mixture of white flour (White RoseÔ, White Rose Flour Mills, Byford, WA, U.S.A.) and lard (TenderflakeÔ, Maple Leaf Foods, Toronto, ON, Canada).""",,"
The paper does not explicitly state the Latin binomial name of the prey species used in the experiment. However, the paper mentions that the artificial prey were ""modelled loosely on Papilio canadensis"", which is the Canadian tiger swallowtail butterfly. This is supported by the following quotes:

Field experiments on the effectiveness of 'eyespots' as predator deterrents,"Martin Stevens, Elinor Hopkins, William Hinde, Amabel Adcock, Yvonne Connolly, Tom Troscianko, Innes C Cuthill, K T Troscianko",-,-,-,-,-,Stevens_2007.pdf,Not mentioned (none),"  - ""For all experiments, artificial moth-like stimuli (not designed to mimic any real species) were made from triangular pieces of waterproof card (HP LaserJet Tough Paper; Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA, U.S.A.), 50 mm wide at the base and 25 mm high, printed with specific patterns on a Hewlett Packard LaserJet 4050N printer.""
  - ""The protocol of each experiment was similar to that of Cuthill et al. (2005).

The paper does not mention any specific prey species that was used in the experiments. Instead, the authors used artificial ""moth-like stimuli"" that were not designed to mimic any real species. This is evident from the following quotes:

""For all experiments, artificial moth-like stimuli (not designed to mimic any real species) were made from triangular pieces of waterproof card (HP LaserJet Tough Paper; Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA, U.S.A.), 50 mm wide at the base and 25 mm high, printed with specific patterns on a Hewlett Packard LaserJet 4050N printer.""

Significance of butterfly eyespots as an anti-predator device in ground-based and aerial attacks,"Anne Lyytinen, Paul M Brakefield, Johanna Mappes",-,-,,91,2003,Lyytinen_2003.pdf,Bicyclus anynana,"  - ""Bicyclus anynana (Satyrinae) shows variation in number, size, shape, colour composition, and position of eyespots (Brakefield and French 1999).""
  - ""To test the deflection hypothesis, we compared the survival of the spotless dry season form and spotted wet season form of Bicyclus anynana and examined the target of initial strike.""",,"
The paper clearly states that the prey species used in the experiments was Bicyclus anynana, a satyrine butterfly:
""Bicyclus anynana (Satyrinae) shows variation in number, size, shape, colour composition, and position of eyespots (Brakefield and French 1999).""
""To test the deflection hypothesis, we compared the survival of the spotless dry season form and spotted wet season form of Bicyclus anynana and examined the target of initial strike.""
""Furthermore, we used a double mutant line, Bigeye-comet, in which all the eyespots are larger in size than in the wet season form.""
The paper does not mention any other prey species being used in the experiments, so the prey species is solely Bicyclus anynana.

The Feeding Behaviour of Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) in the Presence of 'Eyes',"I R Inglis, L W Huson, M B Marshall, P A Arid,  Neville",-,-,-,-,-,Inglis_1983.pdf,none,"  - ""BLEST (1957) demonstrated in experiments involving the predation of Aglais urticae by yellow buntings (Emberiza citrinefla) and reed buntings (Emberiza schoenicufus), how essential the patterns are in such defence.""
  - ""The wings of many insects bear circular patterns, ""eyespots"" which resemble the vertebrate eye. Eyespot patterns are associated with displays which exhibit them and appear t o be an anti-predator device frequently eliciting flight in the passerine predators of these insects.""",,"
The paper does not mention any specific prey species that the eye-like patterns are meant to resemble. The paper focuses on the effects of different eye-like patterns on the feeding behavior of starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), which are the subject species, not the prey species. There is no mention of any butterfly, moth, caterpillar or other prey species that the eye-like patterns are meant to mimic. The paper cites previous work by Blest that found eye-like patterns on butterflies can elicit escape responses in their passerine predators, but the current study does not use any actual prey species.

The position of eyespots and thickened segments influence their protective value to caterpillars,"John Skelhorn, Giles Dorrington, Thomas J Hossie, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,,15,2014,Skelhorn_2014.pdf,"Papilio canadensis, Papilio glaucus","  - ""based loosely on the appearance of the late instars of Papilio canadensis and Papilio glaucus caterpillars.""
  - ""We followed Hossie and Sherratt's (2013) method of producing countershaded pastry caterpillars based loosely on the appearance of the late instars of Papilio canadensis and Papilio glaucus caterpillars.""",,"
The paper states that the artificial caterpillars used in the experiments were ""based loosely on the appearance of the late instars of Papilio canadensis and Papilio glaucus caterpillars"":
""We followed Hossie and Sherratt's (2013) method of producing countershaded pastry caterpillars based loosely on the appearance of the late instars of Papilio canadensis and Papilio glaucus caterpillars.""
Therefore, the prey species used in this study were Papilio canadensis and Papilio glaucus caterpillars.

The paper does not mention the prey species used in the experiments. Instead, it describes the use of ""gray-scale artificial 'prey,' 76 mm wide and 38 mm high, made from triangular pieces of waterproof paper"" that were printed with various patterns.
