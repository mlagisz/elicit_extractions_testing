Body size affects the evolution of eyespots in caterpillars,"Thomas John Hossie, John Skelhorn, Jesse W Breinholt, Akito Y Kawahara, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,49,2015,Hossie_2015.pdf,no,"  - ""Here we provide a thorough analysis of the phylogenetic distribution of eyespots in hawkmoth caterpillars, and a clear answer as to why eyespots are not ubiquitous in lepidopteran larvae more generally. Our phylogenetic analysis clearly demonstrates that the evolution of eyespots is associated with large body size, and our field and laboratory experiments provide an explanation for this; eyespots increase predation rates on small caterpillars by making them easier to detect, but-at least as far as our laboratory data and previous studies (11,12) indicate-large eyespots decrease predation rates on large caterpillars, likely because they intimidate predators (see also ref. 33).""",,"
The paper does not contain a section explicitly describing the authors' contributions. There is no section with a heading like ""Author Contributions"" or similar. The closest the paper comes is the following quote:

The position of eyespots and thickened segments influence their protective value to caterpillars,"John Skelhorn, Giles Dorrington, Thomas J Hossie, Thomas N Sherratt",-,-,,15,2014,Skelhorn_2014.pdf,yes,"  - ""We followed Hossie and Sherratt's (2013) method of producing countershaded pastry caterpillars based loosely on the appearance of the late instars of Papilio canadensis and Papilio glaucus caterpillars.""

The paper does not contain a section explicitly describing the authors' contributions. There is no section with a heading like ""Author Contributions"" or similar. However, the paper does provide some information about the roles of the authors:
""John Skelhorn, Giles Dorrington, Thomas J Hossie, Thomas N Sherratt (2014).""
This indicates that the four authors listed conducted the research and wrote the paper.
""We followed Hossie and Sherratt's (2013) method of producing countershaded pastry caterpillars based loosely on the appearance of the late instars of Papilio canadensis and Papilio glaucus caterpillars.""
This quote suggests that Hossie and Sherratt, who are two of the authors, had previously developed the method used to create the artificial caterpillars in this study.
""Molds used by Hossie and Sherratt (2013) were shipped to United Kingdom to ensure that our anterior-thickening treatment was identical to theirs.""
This quote further indicates that Hossie and Sherratt, the two authors, had previously conducted related research that informed the methods used in this study.
