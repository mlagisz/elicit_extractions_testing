The paper examines the effect of male mating history on female reproductive output across multiple Lepidoptera species, so the taxonomic scope is ""multiple species from a specific taxon"". This is evident from the following quotes:

""We therefore performed a metaanalysis using data from 29 studies of 25 species.""
""We classified species on the basis of mating pattern and taxonomic group (Table 2 ). Species were scored as either Rhopalocera (butterflies and skippers) or Heterocera (moths).""
""We then discuss possible reasons why male mating history, presumably acting through its effect on spermatophore size, might have a stronger effect in polyandrous than monandrous species.""

The paper focuses on Lepidoptera species, which is a specific taxonomic group, rather than all possible organisms.

Assortative Mating in Animals,"Yuexin Jiang, Daniel I Bolnick, Mark Kirkpatrick",-,-,American Naturalist,363,2013,Jiang_2013.pdf,multiple species from all taxa,"  - ""we carried out a metaanalysis of published measures of assortative mating for a variety of phenotypic and genotypic traits in a diverse set of animal taxa.""
  - ""Plants are not included in our study simply because too few studies reported appropriate effect size statistics. We did not include humans because strong cultural influences and substantial recent admixture make human assortative mating hard to compare with other species""",,"
The paper states that the study focused on a diverse set of animal taxa, not just a single species or a specific taxonomic group:
""We carried out a metaanalysis of published measures of assortative mating for a variety of phenotypic and genotypic traits in a diverse set of animal taxa.""
The paper also mentions that they excluded plants and humans from the analysis:
""Plants are not included in our study simply because too few studies reported appropriate effect size statistics. We did not include humans because strong cultural influences and substantial recent admixture make human assortative mating hard to compare with other species.""
This indicates that the study looked at multiple species from all taxa, excluding plants and humans.

The paper states that the study synthesized data from 72 studies on 66 animal species, providing estimates of Bateman's parameters for males and females. This indicates that the taxonomic scope of the study was ""multiple species from all taxa"", as it covered a wide range of animal species across the animal kingdom rather than focusing on a single species or a specific taxonomic group.

Measuring and interpreting sexual selection metrics: evaluation and guidelines,"Nils Anthes, Ines K H € Aderer, Nico K Michiels, Tim Janicke",-,-,,41,2017,Anthes_2017.pdf,multiple species from a specific taxon,"  - ""Drawing from a recent meta-analysis, we evaluate potential biases arising from study design, data collection and parameter estimation, and provide suggestions to mitigate such biases in future studies.""

The paper does not explicitly state the taxonomic scope of the study. However, based on the content, it appears to be focused on multiple species from a specific taxon, rather than a single species or multiple species from all taxa.

The paper discusses various studies on sexual selection metrics across different species, indicating a broader taxonomic scope than a single species. For example:
""Previous empirical work has been dominated by summary metrics proposed to reflect the opportunity for, and strength of, sexual selection (Table 1).""
""Drawing from a recent meta-analysis, we evaluate potential biases arising from study design, data collection and parameter estimation, and provide suggestions to mitigate such biases in future studies.""
""We scrutinize the quantification of (sex differences in) sexual selection metrics with respect to three components: the underlying study design (section 'Study design'), data collection (section 'Data collection'), and parameter estimation (section 'Parameter estimation').""

However, the paper does not indicate that the scope covers multiple species from all taxa. Instead, the focus appears to be on a specific taxonomic group, as evidenced by the detailed discussion of methods and examples from particular species, such as:
""Recent examples testing how environmental factors affect the strength of sexual selection include manipulations of sex ratio (Jones et al. 2000(Jones et al. , 2005;;Jones, Arguello & Arnold 2004;Aronsen et al. 2013), population density (Aronsen et al. 2013;Wacker et al. 2013), mating frequency (Andrade & Kasumovic 2005), nest availability (Singer et al. 2006), or food availability (Janicke, David & Chapuis 2015;Morimoto, Pizzari & Wigby 2016).""

Based on these quotes, the taxonomic scope of the study was ""multiple species from a specific taxon"", as it focused on a broad range of species from different taxonomic groups, but did not cover all possible organisms.

The relative importance of size and asymmetry in sexual selection,"R Thornhid', A P M0ller, A P Moller",-,-,,87,1998,Thornhill_1998.pdf,multiple species from all taxa,"  - ""We collected information on the relationship between success in sexual competition and size and asymmetry, respectively, to assess the relative importance of these two factors in sexual selection.

To determine the taxonomic scope of the study, I will look for information in the paper that indicates the breadth of species covered.

This quote suggests that the data set used in the present study was drawn from a broad literature search, rather than being focused on a specific taxonomic group.

  - ""These two species are very closely related and morphologically very similar and were only described as separate species relatively recently (Deckert 1985).""",,"
The taxonomic scope of this study is focused on multiple species from a specific taxon. This can be seen from the following quotes:
""Lygaeus equestris L. and L. simulans Deckert are two closely related species of lygaeid bug (Heteroptera: Lygaeiodea; Lygaeinae).""
""These two species are very closely related and morphologically very similar and were only described as separate species relatively recently (Deckert 1985).""
""Significant differences in genital morphology between closely related species suggest that genital evolution has occurred relatively rapidly.""
The paper specifically focuses on two closely related species of lygaeid bugs, Lygaeus equestris and Lygaeus simulans, rather than a single species or multiple species from all taxa.
