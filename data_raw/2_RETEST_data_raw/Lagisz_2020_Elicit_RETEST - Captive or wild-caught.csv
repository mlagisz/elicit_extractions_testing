Can the way pigs are handled alter behavioural and physiological measures of affective state?,"Ricard Carreras, Laura Arroyo, Eva Mainau, Daniel Valent, Anna Bassols, Antoni Dalmau, Luigi Faucitano, Xavier Manteca, Antonio Velarde",-,-,Behavioural Processes,16,2017,Carreras2017.pdf,captive,"  - ""The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of IRTA.""
  - ""Pens (5 × 2.7 m) had fully slatted floor and were under natural light conditions at a constant environmental temperature (22 ± 3 °C). Each pen was provided with one steel drinker bowl (15 × 16 cm) connected to a nipple and a concrete feeder (58 × 34 cm) with four feeding places. Pigs had water and food ad libitum.""

The paper does not explicitly state whether the pigs used in the experiment were captive or wild-caught. However, it provides several details about the source and housing of the pigs that suggest they were captive animals:
""At 9 weeks of age, pigs were transported from a commercial farm to the experimental facilities of IRTA (Monells, Spain) and housed in two rooms of four pens with seven pigs each.""
This quote indicates that the pigs were obtained from a commercial farm, rather than being wild-caught.
""Pens (5 × 2.7 m) had fully slatted floor and were under natural light conditions at a constant environmental temperature (22 ± 3 °C). Each pen was provided with one steel drinker bowl (15 × 16 cm) connected to a nipple and a concrete feeder (58 × 34 cm) with four feeding places. Pigs had water and food ad libitum.""
This description of the pigs' housing conditions, with features like slatted floors, drinker bowls, and feeders, is typical of captive, domesticated pigs rather than wild pigs.
""The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of IRTA.""
The involvement of an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee further suggests that these were captive animals, as wild-caught animals would not typically undergo such oversight.

The paper does not explicitly state whether the pigs used in the experiment were captive or wild-caught. However, it provides several details that suggest the pigs were captive:
""A total of 40 entire male and female crossbred pigs (Large White × Landrace), which had previously experienced the same housing and management conditions, were selected at approximately 14 weeks of age and 45 kg live weight.""
This quote indicates that the pigs were a crossbred domestic breed (Large White × Landrace) and had previously experienced the same housing and management conditions, suggesting they were captive animals rather than wild-caught.
""All experimental procedures and animal care were carried out in accordance with the minimum standards for the protection of pigs laid down by law (Council of The European Union, 2008), and were approved by the Ethical Review Committee of Newcastle University.""
This quote further suggests the pigs were captive animals, as the experiment followed legal standards for the protection of pigs and was approved by an ethics committee, which would not be the case for wild-caught animals.
""Pens were located in the same controlled environment, fan ventilated room with the temperature set for 20 • C. Artificial lighting provided at least 40 lx for a period of 11 h per day. Pigs were manually fed once daily with a dry pelleted concentrate (A-One Feeds Ltd, Thirsk, UK) distributed on the solid pen floor and spread evenly so that all pigs could feed simultaneously.""
This quote describes the controlled housing environment and feeding regimen of the pigs, which is characteristic of captive animals rather than wild-caught.

  - ""At 9 weeks of age, pigs were transported from a commercial farm to the experimental facilities of IRTA (Monells, Spain) and housed separately by gender and genotype in 8 pens (6 pigs per pen).""",,"
The paper does not explicitly state whether the pigs used in the experiment were captive or wild-caught. However, it provides several details about the source and housing of the pigs that suggest they were captive animals:
""At 9 weeks of age, pigs were transported from a commercial farm to the experimental facilities of IRTA (Monells, Spain) and housed separately by gender and genotype in 8 pens (6 pigs per pen).""
This indicates the pigs were obtained from a commercial farm, rather than being wild-caught.
""Pigs were kept in pens (5 × 2.7 m) on fully slatted floor under natural light conditions and at a constant environmental temperature of 22 ± 3 • C. Each pen was provided with one steel drinker bowl (15 × 16 cm) connected to a nipple and with a concrete feeder (58 × 34 cm) with four feeding places. Pigs had water and feed ad libitum.""
The detailed description of the pigs' housing conditions, including pens, feeders, and ad libitum access to food and water, further suggests these were captive, domesticated pigs rather than wild-caught animals.

"Effects of Cage Enrichment on Behavior, Welfare and Outcome Variability in Female Mice","Jeremy D Bailoo, Eimear Murphy, Maria Boada-Saña, Justin A Varholick, Sara Hintze, Caroline Baussière, Kerstin C Hahn, Christine Göpfert, Rupert Palme, Bernhard Voelkl, Hanno Würbel",-,-,Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience,85,2018,Bailoo_2018.pdf,captive,"  - ""All mice were ear-tattooed for identification by the same two experimenters (JB and EM) on the day following arrival at the laboratory.""
  - ""Here, using 96 C57BL/6 and SWISS female mice, respectively, we systematically varied environmental enrichment across four levels spanning the range of common enrichment strategies:""",,"
The paper does not explicitly state whether the mice used in the experiment were captive or wild-caught. However, based on the information provided, we can infer that the mice were captive:

""Here, using 96 C57BL/6 and SWISS female mice, respectively, we systematically varied environmental enrichment across four levels spanning the range of common enrichment strategies...""
""All mice were ear-tattooed for identification by the same two experimenters (JB and EM) on the day following arrival at the laboratory.""

The paper mentions that the mice were from specific inbred (C57BL/6JRj) and outbred (RjOrl:SWISS) strains, which suggests they were obtained from a commercial supplier rather than being wild-caught. Additionally, the mice were ear-tattooed upon arrival at the laboratory, indicating they were not wild animals.

  - ""Twenty-nine female non-lactating and non-gestating Lacaune sheep about 2.5 years of age made up the two groups used in this experiment (Vögeli et al., 2014).""",,"
The paper does not explicitly state whether the sheep used in the experiment were captive or wild-caught. However, it provides some relevant details about the animals:
""Twenty-nine female non-lactating and non-gestating Lacaune sheep about 2.5 years of age made up the two groups used in this experiment (Vögeli et al., 2014).""
This suggests the sheep were captive, as they were specifically selected and housed in groups for the experiment.
""To induce a relatively more negative or more positive mood, the sheep had been subjected to either unpredictable, stimulus-poor or predictable, stimulus-rich housing conditions, respectively, since July 2011 (Vögeli et al., 2014).""
This further indicates the sheep were captive, as they were housed and subjected to experimental conditions over an extended period of time.
""All sheep had permanent access to water.""
This detail about the housing conditions also implies the sheep were captive, as wild-caught animals would not have such controlled access to water.

"Measurement of cognitive bias and cortisol levels to evaluate the effects of space restriction on captive collared peccary (Mammalia, Tayassuidae)","Flávia R M Oliveira, Sérgio L G Nogueira-Filho, Maria B C Sousa, Carlos T S Dias, Michael Mendl, Selene S C Nogueira",-,-,,11,2016,Oliveira2016.pdf,captive,"  - ""The experimental animals, aged between 4 and 6 years old and weighing 23.0 ± 2.2 kg, were from the same herd (N = 23), born and raised in captive conditions.""",,"
The paper explicitly states that the experimental animals were from the same herd (N = 23), born and raised in captive conditions:
""The experimental animals, aged between 4 and 6 years old and weighing 23.0 ± 2.2 kg, were from the same herd (N = 23), born and raised in captive conditions.""
This indicates that all the animals used in the experiment were captive-born and raised, and not wild-caught. The paper does not mention any wild-caught animals being used.

  - ""Female Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) were hatched and reared at the Institute of Animal Biochemistry and Genetics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Ivanka pri Dunaji, Slovak Republic.""",,"
The paper states that the female Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) used in the experiments were ""hatched and reared at the Institute of Animal Biochemistry and Genetics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Ivanka pri Dunaji, Slovak Republic."" This indicates that the quail were captive-bred and not wild-caught.
""Female Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) were hatched and reared at the Institute of Animal Biochemistry and Genetics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Ivanka pri Dunaji, Slovak Republic.""
The paper does not mention anything about the quail being wild-caught, and explicitly states they were hatched and reared at the institute, further supporting that they were captive animals.

Validation of a novel cognitive bias task based on difference in quantity of reinforcement for assessing environmental enrichment,"Heidi A Keen, O Lynne Nelson, Charles T Robbins, Marc Evans, David J Shepherdson, Ruth C Newberry",-,-,-,-,-,Keen2014.pdf,captive,"  - ""The facility was equipped with security cameras (Open Eye, Liberty Lake, WA, USA) such that all indoor dens, outdoor runs, and the sidewalk area leading to the yard were continuously recorded.""
  - ""Bears were housed in pairs in 32-m 2 indoor/outdoor concretefloored enclosures equipped with a hanging tire for enrichment and given daily access to a 0.81-ha semi-natural exercise yard, climbing frame, wooden logs, and water bath, with other socially compatible individuals.""
  - ""Eight adult grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) from the Washington State University Bear Research, Education, and Conservation Center participated in this study.""",,"
The paper states that the study was conducted using captive grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) from the Washington State University Bear Research, Education, and Conservation Center. Specifically, the paper mentions:
""Eight adult grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) from the Washington State University Bear Research, Education, and Conservation Center participated in this study.""
""Bears were housed in pairs in 32-m 2 indoor/outdoor concrete-floored enclosures equipped with a hanging tire for enrichment and given daily access to a 0.81-ha semi-natural exercise yard, climbing frame, wooden logs, and water bath, with other socially compatible individuals.""
""The facility was equipped with security cameras (Open Eye, Liberty Lake, WA, USA) such that all indoor dens, outdoor runs, and the sidewalk area leading to the yard were continuously recorded.""
The paper clearly states that the bears used in the study were captive animals from a research facility, and does not mention any wild-caught bears. Therefore, the source of the animals used in the experiment was captive.
