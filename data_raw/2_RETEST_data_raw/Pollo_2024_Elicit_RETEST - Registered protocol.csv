Variation in pre-and post-copulatory sexual selection on male genital size in two species of lygaeid bug,"Liam R Dougherty, David M Shuker",-,-,Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology,18,2016,Dougherty_2016.pdf,no,"  - ""We assessed how the strength and pattern of selection on processus length varied between different stages of mating (before or after mating), social contexts (the number of males and females present during mating trials) and studies.""
  - ""We present the results of two experiments. In the first, we correlated processus length with male reproductive success using a sample of L. equestris males used in a previous experiment in which mating trials were performed using four experimental choice designs (Dougherty and Shuker 2014). We then performed a second experiment in L. simulans in which male reproductive success was recorded in no-choice mating trials.""
